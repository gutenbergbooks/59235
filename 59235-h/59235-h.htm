<p><a id="I_freely_admit"></a>I freely admit what all the
world knows about <span class="smcap">François
Rabelais</span>.</p>

<p>Long before the day when
Fielding and Smollett began to
be read on the sly, and before
the comic Muse of Congreve
and Wycherly began to be
looked at askance, that English
moral sentiment, over which Macaulay
was to philosophize more
than a century later, had solidified
in ignoring Rabelais. Nothing
is to be said against the sentiment itself. This has always been
fairly righteous, if just a bit undiscriminating. A great humorist,
showing himself content to grovel in the dirt, is, beyond question,
deserving of black looks and shut doors. But more than most old
masters of a type, strong, albeit coarse, Rabelais&mdash;from the distinctly
marked physical attributes of his chief personages&mdash;may
claim certain good points which, drawn out and grouped together,
ought to fall within the circle of those tales which interest children.</p>

<p>I have read Rabelais twice in my life. Each time, I have read
him in that old French, which has no master quite so great as he;
and each time in Auguste Desrez's edition, which, in its careful
<i>Table des Matières</i>, learned glossary, quaint notes, Gallicized Latin
and Greek words, and a complete <i>Rabelaisiana</i>, shows the devotion
of the rare editor, who does not distort, because he understands,
the Master whom he edits. When I first peeped into his pages
I was a lad, altogether too young to be tainted by profanity,
while I skipped, true boy-fashion, whole pages to pick out the
wondrous story of his Giants. When I came back to him, after
many years, I was both older and, I hope, wiser. Being older,
I had learned to gauge him better, both in his strength and in his
weakness. I had come to see wherein an old prejudice was too
just to be safely resisted; and, on the other hand, wherein it had
got to be so deeply set that it had hardened to injustice. As I went
on, it did not take me long to discover that it was quite possible for
my purpose&mdash;following, indeed, the path unconsciously taken in my
boyhood&mdash;to divide Rabelais sharply into incident and philosophy.
That this had not been thought of before surprised, but did not daunt
me. I said to myself: I shall limit the incident strictly to his three
Giants; I shall hold these, from grandfather to grandson, well together;
keep all that is sound in them; cut away the impurity which
is not so much <i>of</i> as <i>around</i> them; chisel them out as a sculptor
might, and leave his philosophy with face to the wall. This done,
I turned the scouring hose, full and strong, upon the incidents themselves,
clearing out both dialectics and profanity thoroughly. I did
not stop until I had left the famous trio, <span class="smcap">Grandgousier, Gargantua</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span> where I had, from the first, hoped to place them,&mdash;high
and dry above the scum which had so long clogged their rare
good-fellowship, and which had made men of judgment blind to
the genuine worth that was in them.</p>

<p>In this way I believed that I saw the chance to free Rabelais'
Giants, so long kept in bonds, from a captivity which has dishonored
them. To do this was clearly running against that good old law
which has invariably made all Giants&mdash;far back from fairy-time&mdash;thunder-voiced,
great-toothed, rude-handed, hard-hearted, bloody-minded
creatures and truculent captors, never, on any account, pitiful
captives. But, to such, the Rabelaisian Giants are none of kin.
No more are they of blood to that Giant that Jack slew, or that
Giant Despair, in whose garden-court Bunyan dreamt that he saw
the white bones of slaughtered pilgrims.</p>

<p>Public sentiment has hitherto illogically retched at the name of
Rabelais, while it swallows without qualm "Tristram Shandy" and
"Gulliver's Travels." Shall it always retch? The time, I think, is
practically taking the answer into its own hands. Rabelais, through
some cotemporaneous influence, rising subtly in his favor among men
who are neither afraid nor ashamed to judge for themselves, is, in
one sense, slowly becoming a naturalized citizen of our modern Literary
Republic. Literature and Art are joining hands in his rehabilitation.
Mr. Walter Besant, a novelist, has been so good as to write
his life; to say bright words about him; and to quote clean things
from him. Mrs. Oliphant, a purist, has consented to admit him into
her "Foreign Classics for English Readers." Three years ago M.
Emile Hébert's bronze statue of him was unveiled at that Chinon, his
birthplace, which he lovingly calls "the most ancient city of the
world." And, to crown all, as the latest expression of a tardy recognition,
his bust by M. Truphème was, only the other day, uncovered
at that Meudon of which he was, for a time, the famous, if not
always orthodox, Curé.</p>

<p>Rabelais himself never, it is clear, appreciated his Giants save for
the contrasted jollity which they lent to his satires.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<i>Mieulx est de ris que de larmes escripre,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Pour ce que rire est le propre de lhomme,</i>"</span><br />
</p>

<p>was his maxim. But this maxim never rose to a creed. His Giants
seem, almost against his will, to stride beyond the territory of mere
burlesque. They are as easily free from theology as from science.
They have never been of La Bâmette. They are as far from Montpellier.
To these colossal creations, heroes fashioned in ridicule of
the old fantastico-chivalric deeds of their age, as they come down
more and more from the clouds, are more and more given the feelings
common to this earth's creatures. All three bear, from their
birth, a sturdy human sympathy not natural to their kind, as mediæval
superstition classed it. Two of them, in being brought to the
level of humanity, join with this a simple Christian manliness and a
childlike faith under all emergencies, not set on their own massive
strength, but fixed on God, whom they had been taught to know,
and honor, and serve&mdash;and all this by whom? Forsooth, by the
same François Rabelais, laugher, mocker, and "insensate reviler."
From Grandgousier, the good-hearted guzzler, through Gargantua,
with his heady youth and wise old age, to "the noble Pantagruel,"
the gain in purity and Christian manhood is steady. The royal
race of Chalbroth follows no track beaten down by other kingly
lines known to history. While their line descends from father to
son, it ascends in virtue.</p>

<p>One charge&mdash;a legacy from the narrow times when run-mad commentators
spied a plot in every folio&mdash;has followed, to this day, Rabelais
and his work. Wise men have, to their own satisfaction, proved
the latter to be an enigma filled with hidden meanings, dangerous to
state and morals; with mad attacks directed, from every chapter,
against ordered society; with satiric thrusts lurking, in every sentence,
against Pope, and King, and nobles; in brief, a Malay-muck run with
a pen, instead of a knife, against the moral foundations of the world.
All these, if not true, are certainly "like, very like" the Rabelais as
he is painted by purists in the gallery of great authors. If true,
they have wrought more subtly than all else in the forging of those
heavy chains which have been bound, coil upon coil, around his hapless
big men. It is not to be wondered at that even their mighty
number of cubits should have been smothered under the fine, slow-settling
dust of three centuries. Happily, however, fair play has
been, of old, the standing boast of all English-speaking men.
François Rabelais&mdash;never once deigning to ask for it at home, when
living&mdash;has, in penalty therefor, been ferociously denied it abroad,
when dead. To that sentiment&mdash;moved, it may be, by a concurrent
testimony given, in this age, to the memory of the author
himself&mdash;I appeal now in behalf of his Giants. That they have
fared badly through all these centuries, mostly by reason of him,
cannot be gainsaid. That of themselves, however, they have in no
wise merited such ostracism, is what I have ventured to claim in
this compilation. Freed alike from that prejudice which has hunted
them down, and from those formidable</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"... points of ignorance</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pertaining thereunto,"</span><br />
</p>

<p>which have, so far, blocked every avenue to modern sympathy,
I would have them honored, among all stout lovers of fair play,
as I leave them in this "Explanation by way of Preface."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4>HOW THE FIRST GIANTS CAME INTO THE WORLD.</h4>


<p>At the beginning of the world the pure blood of Abel, shed by
his wicked brother Cain, made the soil very rich. Every fruit
seemed to grow that year to a dozen times its usual size. But
the fruit that seemed to thrive best, and to taste most toothsome, and
to be most eaten, was the medlar. So much of that fruit was eaten
at that particular time that the year came to be called the "Year
of Medlars."</p>

<p>Now, in this "Year of Medlars," the good men and women who
lived then happened to eat a little too much of this fine fruit. It was
all very nice while it was being eaten; but, somehow, after a little
time it was found that terrible swellings, but not all in the same place,
came out on those who had shown themselves too fond of the fruit.</p>

<p>Some grew big and twisted in their shoulders, and became what
were afterwards called Hunch-backs.</p>

<p>Some found
themselves with longer
legs than others,
which, being quite as
thin and bony as they
were long, made malicious
people, who
had not eaten of the
fruit, shout, "Crane!
Crane! Long-legged
Crane!" whenever
one of the poor people
showed himself.</p>

<p>Some there were
who could boast of a
nose as red as it was
long and knotty,
which made evil-tongued
men say they
had been more among
the grapes than among
the medlars. But this
was, after all, the fault
of the medlars. There
was no doubt of that.</p>

<p>Others, having a
special love for picking
out everybody's
secrets, found their
medlars running into big ears, which grew so long that they soon
hung down to their breasts. And those who once had the Big Ear
lost, after that, all desire for other people's secrets, because their ears
were so large they caught everything bad their neighbors were always
saying about them.</p>

<p>Others&mdash;and now, listen&mdash;grew long in legs, but not longer in
legs than they grew stout in body, and it was from these people that
the Giants sprang. When those who grew so long in legs and so
stout in body began to walk on the earth, the neighbors did their best
to please them. You may be sure there was no talk about medlars
then.</p>

<p>The first who became known as a giant was called <span class="smcap"><a id="Chalbroth"></a>Chalbroth</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 227px;">
<img src="images/003.jpg" width="227" height="350" alt="engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE GIANT CHALBROTH.</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chalbroth</span> was the father of all the Giants, and the great-grandfather
of Hurtali, who reigned in the time of the Deluge, and who
was lucky enough not to be drowned in the deep waters.</p>

<p>Doubtless, the eyes of some of my young readers are twinkling,
and they are ready to cry out very positively: "Oh, no! There was
no Giant in Noah's Ark, you know. How could there be? Only
Noah and his family were in the Ark. The Bible says that!"</p>

<p>There was one Wise Man, however, who lived a long time after
the first Giant had appeared, and after many great ones had been
noticed, and who had seen some with his own eyes. This Wise Man
had thought, in a quiet way, a great deal about the Big People, and,
through much study, had found out why it was they were not all
drowned.</p>

<p>This Wise Man makes himself very clear on this point. He says
that Hurtali&mdash;the great-grandson of Chalbroth, the first Giant&mdash;escaped
the Deluge, not by getting <i>into</i> the Ark,&mdash;it was altogether too
small for that,&mdash;but by getting <i>outside</i> of it. In other words, he used
it as a man strides a horse, riding on top of it, with one huge leg hanging
over the right side and the other over the left. If Hurtali was
very heavy, the Blessed Ark was very stout. He got so used to his
seat after a while, that, being on the outside, and able to see everything
around him, he made his long legs do for the Ark just what the rudder
of a ship does for her. He must have saved it from many and many a
rough shock against jutting mountains and sharp rocks as the waters
were rising, and as, after covering the earth, they began to sink lower
and lower; but it may be relied on&mdash;since the Wise Man says so&mdash;that,
during the forty days and nights, Giant Hurtali was on the best
of terms with Noah and all his family.
This might look strange; but it appears
that there was on the top of the Ark a
chimney, and it was through this chimney
that Hurtali could always, for the
asking, have his share of his favorite pottage <a id="handed_up_to_him"></a>handed up to him.</p>

<img src="images/004.jpg" width="400" height="326" alt="engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE GIANT HURTALI ON THE ARK.</div>
</div>

<p>It would really be of no use to tell the names of all the Giants
who came between Hurtali and our merry old King Grandgousier.
Some of them you already know. Long after Hurtali came Goliath,
the Giant, whom young David slew with his sling and stone; Briareus,
the Greek Giant of a hundred hands; King Porus, the Indian Giant,
who fought with Alexander, and was defeated by him; and the famous
Giant Bruyer, slain by Ogier the Dane, Peer of France. There are so
many of them that I would soon grow tired of giving, and you of hearing,
even their names. All that we care about knowing is that, in a
straight line from Hurtali, the Giant who rode on the Blessed Ark, the
fifty-fourth was <span class="smcap">Grandgousier</span>, who was the father of <span class="smcap">Gargantua</span>,
who, in his turn, was the father of <span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span>.</p>

<p>These are the three Giants whose story I am about to tell, two
of whom will prove more wonderful heroes than are to be read of either
in ancient or modern history.</p>

<p><a id="King_Grandgousier"></a>King Grandgousier&mdash;the fifty-seventh
in a straight line from Chalbroth,
the first Giant&mdash;was a jovial
King in his day. Although a Giant,
he was the pink of politeness and kindly
feeling. His whole life was one continual
dinner. He was very fond of his
own ease, this jovial King, but he also
loved to make those around him happy.
He kept open house, and the sun never
rose on a day when there was not some
high lord or some poor pilgrim at his
table, eating and drinking of his best.
He had a great horror of seeing people thirsty around him. "There
is too much good wine flowing in my kingdom for anybody to feel
thirsty. Everybody should drink before he is dry," he was fond of
saying. So one of the main duties of his Chief Butler Turelupin was
to make all the servants, all comers and goers, drink before they were
dry. It was said to take eighteen hundred pipes of wine yearly to do
this. He never was known to look at the clothes a guest wore,&mdash;oh,
no, not he, that good, hearty old King Grandgousier! And it was a
pretty sight to see, whenever a guest or a friend wished to say anything
privately, how tenderly the old Giant would pick him up, and
put him on his knee, and bend his great head and listen ever so carefully
to try and find out what he had to say. His head was lifted so
far above the ground that, otherwise, one would have had to shout out
loud enough for <a id="all_in_the_palace_to_hear"></a>all in the palace to hear.</p>

<div class="caption">KING GRANDGOUSIER KEEPS OPEN HOUSE.</div>
</div>

<p>King Grandgousier was very fond of his wine, and could drink,&mdash;being
a giant,&mdash;at a single meal, more than a dozen common men could
manage to swallow at a dozen meals each.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He was also very fond of
salt meat. He never failed to have on hand a good supply of French
hams, from Mayence and Bayonne,&mdash;the finest known in those days,&mdash;superb
smoked beef-tongues; an abundance
of chitterlings, when in season, and salt beef,
with mustard to spice the whole. All these
fine things were reinforced by sausages from
Bigorre, Longaulnay, and Rouargue,&mdash;the
very best in all France. But there was something which
King Grandgousier loved above everything in the way of
eating, and that was <i>tripes</i>. So fond was he of them that he had
ordered all the royal meadows to be searched, and all the fat beeves
grazing in the royal meadows, three hundred and sixty-seven thousand
and fourteen of them, to be killed, so that there might be plenty of
powdered beef to flavor the royal wine for the season. Then he had
the Royal Herald, with great flourish of trumpets, to name a day on
which all his neighbors&mdash;brave fellows and good players at ninepins&mdash;were
to join him in a Great <a id="Feast_of_Tripes"></a>Feast of Tripes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Children must remember that times have changed for the better since the wild days
of these old giants. To drink so hard and long that a man, from too much wine, would
fall under the table and lie there because not able to move, was looked upon as a virtue
then. Now, in our happier days, we know it to be a virtue for a man to keep himself
sober, and a shame for him to be seen drunk.</p></div>

<div class="caption">THE KING AND QUEEN LOVE TRIPES.</div>
</div>

<p>King Grandgousier had a fair
and stately wife named Gargamelle.
She was a daughter of the King of the Parpaillons, and
was herself a giantess, but not quite so tall as her husband.
Grandgousier and Gargamelle dearly loved one another, and all
that they wanted in this world was a son to bear the father's name,
and be King after him. Queen Gargamelle liked to be in the open
air, and see games of ninepins and ball and leap-frog played by
nimble men and women. And Grandgousier, at such games, was
always found seated at her side, like a good husband, seeming to
enjoy them as much as she did.</p>

<p>At last, one fine day, a little boy was born to them.</p>

<p>He must have been a wonderful baby; because just as soon as he
was born, instead of crying "<i>Mie! mie! mie!</i>" as any other baby
would have done, he shouted out at the top of his lungs, "Drink!
drink! drink!" There never were such lungs as his, everybody said.
The old Doctor himself, and the Three Wise Old Women who were
there, all declared that he had the biggest throat ever known,&mdash;not
even excepting his father's. Now it happened that, of all the days of
the year, the very day the Royal Herald had proclaimed, with flourish
of trumpets, for the famous Feast of Tripes, was the very day on which
the baby Prince was born. When the great news was carried to King
Grandgousier, who was drinking and making merry with his friends,
that he had a son, and that the young Prince was already bawling for
his drink, his joy almost choked him, and he could only find breath to
say in French:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Que grand tu as!</i>"&mdash;meaning "What a big throat thou hast!"</p>

<p>Everybody, including Queen Gargamelle, when she heard of it,
the family Doctor, and the Three Old Wise Women, laughed at this joke
of the King, and declared that it was the very best name that could be
given to the royal babe. From that moment, they began, when talking
to him or speaking of him, to call him little Prince <i>Que-grand-tu-as!</i>
Although they ran these four words trippingly together, and nobody
not in the secret would have thought it more than a very strange
name, yet, somehow, it was too long; and so, little by little, they
kept changing till the very oldest of the Three Old Wise Women,
who had been, one hot day, half-dozing over the cradle, started up
suddenly, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have it!"</p>

<p>"Well, what have you?" called the second oldest, who was wide
awake, sharply.</p>

<p>"The name for our dear little Prince!"</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that, gossip. But why don't you say what it
is?" she snapped in an awful curiosity, and just the least bit jealous.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gargantua</span>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" said the third oldest, who was a mild sort of old lady.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some say that it was the lords and neighbors who were feasting
on the tripes, when the old King cried out, <i>Que grand tu as!</i> who had
shouted back that the young Prince ought to be called "Gargantua."
I am rather afraid that the oldest of the Three Wise Old Women had
been listening at the door of the royal banqueting hall, when she
ought to have been in Queen Gargamelle's chamber.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="When_Father"></a>When Father Grandgousier heard that
the name which the very oldest of the
Wise Women had found for his son had
been fixed for all time, he was delighted
beyond measure, and said to Queen
Gargamelle, while rubbing the palms
of his great hands together:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So the witch has fastened 'Gargantua'
on my boy after all. By my crown!
what we have to do now is never to
let Master Great Throat be empty.
Now, tell me, my dear, where are we
to get milk enough for that throat?"</p>

<p>The Queen looked at her baby; then she looked at her husband;
then she looked into
herself, and, finding
nothing there
to say, smiled,
<a id="and_said_nothing"></a>and said
nothing.</p>

<img src="images/009.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HER BABY.</div>
</div>

<p>When Father Grandgousier called into the Queen's chamber, for
a secret conference, his Royal Butler, who, first asking permission of
their Majesties, called the Royal Steward, who called the Royal Dairyman,
who called the Chief Milkman. After a long talk behind closed
doors, the whole party filed out of the royal apartments, the Chief
Milkman holding in his hand a scroll, showing a large, red seal, and
tied many times around with a broad, red ribbon, the Royal Butler
closing the line and looking wise as a privy-councillor.</p>

<p>The scroll contained an order, authorizing the Chief Milkman&mdash;as
there were not cows enough in the whole kingdom to give such milk
as was needed for the young Prince&mdash;to furnish the remainder. So
there were brought to the royal cattle-yard seventeen thousand nine
hundred and thirteen cows, all famed for the richness of their milk.
Master Gargantua had, luckily, with the milk of these cows, enough
to keep him alive until he was a year and ten months old. Then the
wise old Doctor thought that the child ought to be taken more into
the fresh air. In fact, what the Doctor really wanted, and was half
crazy about not finding, was a carriage suited to the young Prince. A
common baby carriage would not do at all. At last a youthful page,
who dearly loved the strong oxen he had seen during the frequent visits
he was fond of making to the royal stables, thought a fine large cart,
not too pretty but very strong, and drawn by oxen, might do. The
oxen were ready, but they could not be used until the Royal Carpenter
had measured and made a cart that would <a id="hold_the_young_giant"></a>hold the young giant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/010.jpg" width="400" height="208" alt="engraving" />
<div class="caption">AN UNCOMMON BABY CARRIAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>There never was a happier baby
than Gargantua the first time he was
placed in the cart. He was, in truth, a marvel
of a baby, both because his body was so big and his
face was so broad that, from much drinking of milk and good wines,
he could boast of several chins,&mdash;some said nine; others swore there
were ten,&mdash;which lapped each one over the other, as if they felt
they were good company. Every day he would be taken out to ride.
Then when he was tired he would cry, "Drink! drink! drink!"
Whenever that cry was heard, presto! the cart would come to a
stand-still, the oxen would begin to munch, and everybody would
make a rush to the wine-cellar. Of course, the King's son always
had the best wines, and the lackey who was lucky enough to reach
him first when he cried for drink always had the right to a cupful
for himself. So it is quite certain that never was a baby so
well waited on as was Gargantua. He cried "<i>Drink! drink!
drink!</i>" so often that all the servants got to be sad topers from
skipping off to the cellars whenever he called; and it turned out
at last that even the tinkling of an empty glass, as a knife would
strike against it, or the sight of a flagon or a bottle, would make him
jump up and dance with joy, and start him afresh to bawling for
"Drink! drink! drink!" and the lackeys to scampering to the wine-cellar

<h4>THE ROYAL TAILOR'S BILL FOR GARGANTUA'S SUIT.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 195px;">
<img src="images/012.jpg" width="195" height="227" alt="Initial W" />
</div>

<p><a id="When_Gargantua"></a>When Gargantua had outgrown the age
for riding in his ox-cart, and was just
beginning to toddle round the palace-walks,
it occurred to Father Grandgousier
that he was getting to be a big
boy. So he ordered the Royal Tailor
into his Royal Presence.</p>

<p>"So ho! Thou art the clothes-maker,
art thou? Now, measure my
son, and make a suit for him. His
mother says he looks best in blue and
white," was all he said.</p>

<p>The Royal Tailor bowed humbly,
while all the time he was shivering in his fine velvets and silks, at
the honor of making clothes for a Giant Prince. For the old King,
who simply wanted everything loose and easy-like, it was all well
enough; but how would it be when he began to fit the royal heir?
was what he kept asking himself. A royal tailor believes in his
heart that he is a sort of king-maker, because he makes the clothes
that give to a King that grand, imperial air which compels all men
to kneel before him. He never will appear the least bit ruffled at
the most impossible order given him, provided the order come from
a King; but bows and smiles, no matter how sick and angry he may
be at heart.</p>

<p>To do the Royal Tailor justice, he did his best with the order given
him. He made the clothes&mdash;and his bill.</p>

<p>That bill is still kept at Montsoreau. It is really a curiosity, and
runs in this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides all this quantity of rich cloth for Gargantua's full court-suit,
there was brought from Hyrcania the Wild a bright blue feather
for his plume. This plume was held in place by a handsome enameled
clasp of gold, weighing sixty-eight marks, which the Crown Jewellers,
by his father's orders, with great care, made for him; also a ring for
the forefinger of his left hand, with a carbuncle in it as large as an
ostrich-egg; and a great chain of gold berries to wear around his neck,
weighing twenty-five thousand <a id="and_sixty-three_marks"></a>and sixty-three marks.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA AT PLAY.</div>
</div>

<p>From the time he was three years old to the time he had grown
to be a boy of five, Gargantua was brought up, by the strict command
of his father, just like all the other children of the Kingdom.
His education was very simple. It was:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Drinking, eating, and sleeping;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Eating, sleeping, and drinking;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sleeping, drinking, and eating.</span><br />
</p>

<p>If he loved any one thing more than to play in the mud, that was
to roll and wallow about in the mire. He would go home with his
shoes all run down at the heels, and his face and clothes well
streaked with dirt. Gargantua, therefore, was not more favored
than the other little boys of the kingdom who were not so rich as
he was; but there was one advantage which he did have. From his
earliest babyhood he saw so many horses in the Royal Stables that he
got to know a fine horse almost as well as his father did. Whenever
he saw a horse he would clap his fat hands together, and shout at the
top of his lungs. It
was thought that&mdash;being
a Prince who
was, in time, to become
a King&mdash;he
should be taught to
ride well. So they
made him, when he
was a little fellow
of four years, so
fine, so strong, and
so wonderful a
wooden horse that
there had never
been seen its like
up to that date,
and there never has
been found in any
young prince's play-house <a id="or_toy-shop_since"></a>or toy-shop since.</p>

<img src="images/016.jpg" width="333" height="292" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">GARGANTUA'S HORSE.</div>
</div>

<p>This surprising horse must have been a piece of rare workmanship,
because, whenever its young master wanted it to do anything, it
was bound to do it. He could make it leap forward, jump backward,
rear skyward, and waltz, all at one time. He could make it trot, gallop,
rack, pace, gambol, and amble, just as the humor took him. But this
was only half of what that horse could do. Gargantua, at a word,
could make it change the color of its hair. One day its hide would be
milk-white; the next day, bay; the next, black; the next, sorrel; the
next, dapple-gray; the next, mouse-color; the next, piebald; the next,
a soft brown deer-color.</p>

<p>But this was not all.</p>

<p>Gargantua learned to be so skilful that he thought that he might
just as well make a horse to suit himself as to have a horse bought
for him. So he sat knitting his great eyebrows till he finally found
how he could make a hunting-nag out of a big post; one for every
day, out of the beam of a wine-press; one with housings for his
room, out of a great oak-tree; and, out of different kinds of wood
in his father's kingdom, he made ten or twelve spare horses, and had
<a id="seven_for_the_mail"></a>seven for the mail.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA'S RIDING LESSONS.</div>
</div>

<p>It was a rare sight to see all these wooden horses&mdash;bigger toys
than had ever been made before&mdash;lying piled up, side by side, near
Gargantua's bed, and the young Giant sleeping in their midst.</p>

<p>One day, Gargantua had a fine chance for having some sport of
his own making.</p>

<p>It was on the day a noble lord came on a visit to his old friend,
King Grandgousier. The Royal Stables proved rather small for such a
number of horses as came with the noble lord. The Chief Equerry of
the Lord of Breadinbag&mdash;which was the name of the great nobleman&mdash;was
bothered out of his head because he could not find stable-room
for all the horses brought with them. By good luck he and the Grand
Steward happened to meet Gargantua at the foot of <a id="the_great_staircase"></a>the great staircase.</p>

<div class="caption">A NOBLE LORD CAME ON A VISIT.</div>
</div>

<p>"Hello, youngster, what is thy name?"</p>

<p>"Prince Gargantua."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" they cried. "Then say, little Giant, tell us where we
are to put our horses. The stables of thy Royal Father are all full."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know they are," said Gargantua, slily; "all you have to
do is to follow me, and I will show you a beautiful stable, where there
are bigger horses than ever yours can grow to be. Where have you
left your horses?"</p>

<p>"Out in the court-yard, little
Giant."</p>

<p>"Follow me, then,
and I will show
you the stables."</p>

<p>The Chief
Equerry and
the Grand Steward went after him, up the great
staircase of the palace, through the second hall,
into a great stone gallery, by which they entered into a huge stone
tower, the steps to which they mounted, along with the Prince, but
breathing very heavily indeed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that big child is laughing
at us," whispered the Grand Steward,
behind his hand, to the Chief
Equerry. "Nobody ever puts a stable
at the top of a house."</p>

<p>"You are wrong
there," whispered back
the Chief Equerry;
"because I happen to
know of places, in
Lyons and elsewhere,
where there are stables
in the attic. But, to
make sure, let us ask
him again."</p>

<p>Turning to Gargantua,
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My little Prince,
art thou sure thou art
taking us right?"</p>

<p>"Haven't I already told
you? Isn't this my father's
palace, and don't I know the
way to the stables of my big
horses? Don't gasp so much,
gentlemen. Only three little
steps and <a id="we_are_there"></a>we are there!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/019.jpg" width="217" height="450" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">"ONLY THREE LITTLE STEPS."</div>
</div>

<p>Once up the steps, which
made the Chief Equerry and
the Grand Steward blow worse
than ever, and passing through
another great hall, the mischievous
Prince, opening wide
a door,&mdash;that of his own room,&mdash;cried,
triumphantly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here are the finest horses, gentlemen, in the world. This one
next the door is my favorite riding-horse. That one near the fireplace
is my pacer,&mdash;a good one, I assure you. Now, just look at that one
leaning against yonder window. I rode it rather hard yesterday, and
it is tired. That's my hunting-nag. I had it at a great price from
Frankfort; but I am willing to make you a present of it. Don't refuse
me, I beg. Once on it, you can bag all the partridges and hares you
may come across for the whole winter. Now, choose; which of you
will ride my hunting-nag?"</p>

<p>The Chief Equerry and the Grand Steward, knowing that all
these fine names of "riding-horse," and "pacer," and "hunting-nag," were
for mere blocks of wood, were, for a moment, stupefied. They looked
at each other slily, and half ashamed; but the joke was too good when
they thought of the long stairs they had toiled up, and of their horses
below waiting all this time to be stabled and fed. They couldn't help
it; it was too rich; so they laughed till they were tired, and then
began to laugh again till they were tired again.</p>

<p>"A rare bird is this young scamp," panted the Chief Equerry,
as he lifted one end of the great beam which Gargantua called his
hunting-nag.</p>

<p>"A prime joker is this young rogue, if he is a Prince," panted the
Grand Steward, in echo, as he stumbled along with the other end into
the hall.</p>

<p>There was no use in being mad at the trick young Gargantua had
played on them. So they left him stroking the fastest horses in the
world, while they went laughing all the way across the first hall, down
the small steps, across the other halls, along the corridors, past the
stone gallery, down the long stairway as far as the great arch, where
they let the famous hunting-nag roll to the bottom.</p>

<p>When they at last reached the great dining-room, where all their
friends were gathered, they made everybody laugh like a swarm of
flies at the trick played on them by the little Prince with his wooden
horses.</p>

</div>

<p><a id="Old_Father_Grandgousier"></a>Old Father Grandgousier had a very
large body of his own; and, after
the fashion of all good-natured giants
that have ever lived, when he was
pleased he was hugely pleased. So
it happened that, when his friends
came around him to drink his good
wine, and eat his rich dinners, and to
tell him how bright his boy was, he
shook all over with mighty laughter.
"Ho! ho! ho! ho!" he shouted, till the
big strong bottles that stood on his
table jingled, and the very rafters of
the dining-hall seemed to laugh with them.</p>

<p>"You say that my little Gargantua is quick? Ho! ho! Now,
my good lords, Philip of Macedon had a son who was quick too. Yes,
they said that he was as quick as that," snapping his fingers together
so that they went cric-crac like a pistol shot. "You have heard
of the lad, and that wild Bucephalus of his? Bah! I am sure my little
brigand upstairs would never have waited to turn the head of Bucephalus
to the sun before riding him, but would have mounted and
ridden him before all the people, with his tail turned straight to the
sun, and his shadow thrown plain before him! You have decided me,
my friends. Gargantua is already five years old. He is only a baby;
but he is a Giant's child with more wit than age,&mdash;that makes a difference.
I have been thinking seriously lately; and it is high time that
I should give my youngster to some wise man to make him wise
according to his capacity."</p>

<p>And this Father Grandgousier began to do at once. He called,
the very next day,
upon one of his subjects,
worthy Master
Tubal Holofernes, a
man famed for wisdom
the country
round, to teach Gargantua
his A B C's.
I am sorry to say
that Master Holofernes
seemed, from
the first hour, to be
just a little afraid of
his small pupil, who,
although only a baby,
could easily have
studied his alphabet
on his teacher's bald
pate, and had to bend
his head even to do
that. But Father
Grandgousier was, on the whole, well satisfied with his son. Gargantua
could, after five years and three months, actually recite his
alphabet from A to Z; then from Z to A; then catch it sharply
up in the middle, bunching M and N together; naming the letters in
fours, in eights, and in twelves, as quickly as you can think, forward
and back again, and again, till all the old friends&mdash;whose noses, from
good living, had become very red, and whose paunches were very
big&mdash;swore, over their wine, that he was the smartest child of ten
years they <i>ever</i> had seen. Of course, Father Grandgousier thought
all this something wonderful. He ho-ho'ed and he ha-ha'ed! with
great swelling laughter, after the fashion of Giants, until he was all
out of breath, and his friends had to beg him to stop for <a id="fear_of_choking"></a>fear of
choking.</p>

<p>But Father Grandgousier could not rest here. He declared that
Gargantua must now learn Latin. The young Giant was made, not
only to study Latin, but to write, besides that, his own books of study
in Gothic letters, there being no printing-presses in those days.</p>

<p>To learn all this took him thirteen years, six months, and two
weeks.</p>

<p>By this time, Gargantua had
grown so tall that, when called
upon to recite, he
could not
make his answer
heard
by Master
Holofernes,
who was
rather deaf,
unless by
bending
down and
whispering
it, because
his voice
was so
strong that
his ordinary tone would have, at that close distance, broken the
drums of the old man's ears. What he thought he needed, therefore,
was a writing-desk. It was very hard to find a desk quite
suited to him for writing down what he had to say. They hunted
near and far for one. At last one was found in the possession of a
stunted old giant, living in a cave near by, who all his life had
been hoping to grow as tall as King Grandgousier himself. This
poor giant had, however, been thrown into despair because he had
suddenly stopped growing, and still lacked a dozen feet or so of
being as tall as he wanted to be. He gave up the desk he had used so
long, with a great sob that shook the mountain in the caves of which he
lived. Gargantua, although not full-grown, did not find a desk of
seven hundred thousand pounds' weight at all in his way, for it was
just suited to his size.</p>

<p>His ink-horn, weighing as much as a ton of merchandise, swung by
heavy iron chains from the side of the desk. From it Gargantua, with
a pen-holder as large as the great Pillar of Enay, used to write his
Latin exercises. Master Holofernes kept him at all this for
eighteen years and eleven months, and so thorough did he become
that he could recite his Latin exercises by heart, backwards.
He went on studying after this some of the harder books for sixteen
years and two months, when he had the misfortune of losing his old
teacher very suddenly.</p>

<p>One day, unexpectedly, Father Grandgousier called his friends
around him,&mdash;who had, by this time, gained redder noses and
bigger paunches than ever,&mdash;to see how strong his son was in
Latin. He also invited a friend of his who, he was sure, <a id="did_know_Latin"></a>did know
Latin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/022.jpg" width="400" height="391" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE FRIEND WHO KNEW LATIN.</div>
</div>

<p>Then he shouted out, "Come, my little one, and show these friends
of thy father what thou hast learned of Latin. See, here is a gentleman
who knows it as he does his breviary. He shall examine thee, and
tell us how much thou hast learned under faithful Master Holofernes,
whom we all honor."</p>

<p>And the learned friend began on poor Gargantua, and poured on
him question after question for six mortal hours. Father Grandgousier,
who, by the way, had understood not one word of it all, turned
to him at the end triumphantly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, good sir, art thou not convinced that my boy knows
his Latin?"</p>

<p>Then, that learned friend, although just a little trembling, to be
sure, answered quietly enough:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With my Liege's permission, Prince Gargantua does not know
any more Latin than Your own Gracious Majesty."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<i>What!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">What!</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">WHAT!!!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>roared Father Grandgousier, each time making that very short word
longer and louder and fiercer, and jumping to his feet he fairly kicked
learned Master Holofernes out of the palace; meanwhile, rolling his
eyes around in his rage, and gnashing his teeth in so horrible a way
that the noses of his old friends who had sat at his table for sixty
years, and more, turned pale for once, through fright; and there were
those of the household who said that, as they fled from the dining-room,
in terror, even the paunches of these old friends seemed, somehow,
to have grown as flat as the royal pancakes they had <a id="just_been_eating"></a>just been
eating.</p>

<p>"What! not know thy Latin! After forty-eight
years, seven months, and two
days! Then, my little rogue, it is to
Paris thou must go."</p>

<p>This is what Grandgousier said to
Gargantua just one week after that luckless
dinner. I will tell you how it all
happened. The first thing the old
King did the next morning was to send,
post-haste, to his good friend, Don Philip
of the Marshes, Viceroy of Papeligosse,
who knew Latin, and who had told him,
years and years before, that poor Master
Holofernes was nothing but a bit of an old humbug (humbug was
not quite the word used at that time, but the meaning was all the
same). "Come to me, my friend," he wrote, "thou art always
prating of thy Latin scholars. Now bring one of thy wonders along
with thee."</p>

<p>So Don Philip came in great state, as befitted a visit to his King,
accompanied by the prettiest, the jauntiest, the sharpest, the politest,
the sweetest-voiced little fellow ever seen. Don Philip introduced the
curled darling as Master Eudemon, his page.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty sees this child?" he asked. "He is not yet twelve
years old; yet I dare promise that he will prove to Your Majesty, if it
be your pleasure, what difference there really is between the old
dreamers of the past and the lads of the present."</p>

<p>"So be it," cried the old Giant, gaily, as he put on his glasses,
to see the better.</p>

<p>When his eyes first fell on the young page, he swore under his
breath&mdash;which sounded for all the world like stifled thunder&mdash;that
he resembled rather "a little angel than a human child." As soon as
Eudemon was called to show what he knew, he rose with youthful
modesty, and bowed with charming grace to the King, then to his
master, and then to Gargantua, who was frowning at him, and
wondering within himself what all those pretty ways meant. Then
the young page opened in a Latin so good, so pure, and so musical
that what he said sounded rather like a speech
made by a Gracchus, or a Cicero, or an Emilius,
in the old days of Roman glory, than one made
by a youth of that day. After a little,
Eudemon&mdash;cunning rogue that he
was!&mdash;began to praise Gargantua to
the skies. He spoke first of his young
Prince's virtue and good manners;
secondly, of his knowledge; thirdly,
of his noble birth; fourthly, of his
personal beauty; and fifthly, the
little fellow exhorted him so
movingly to revere his great
father in all things that Gargantua
was so ashamed at not
understanding a word of what
he was saying, and at not being
able to Latin away as he
did, forgetting that a dwarf had
no business whatever to criticise
a young Giant, that he began
to <i>moo-moo</i> like a cow, and to hide his face in his cap without
having ever a word <a id="to_say_for_himself"></a>to say for himself.</p>

<div class="caption">EUDEMON.</div>
</div>

<p>Here it was that Father Grandgousier grew really angry. He
praised Eudemon and scolded Gargantua by turns, until at last he fell
asleep among all the big bottles that had been emptied during the
pretty tale of the learned little angel, which nobody around the table
understood but Don Philip of the Marshes and the pretty little angel
himself. It is a bold thing at all times to awake a King without his
own orders; but when that King is a Giant, it is a bolder thing to do
than ever. No one dares, for his head, disturb him, and yet, he has to
be waked, or else the next morning his sneezes will make all the houses
around tumble down, as Giant's colds in the head are just about as big
as their bodies. Now, Gargantua being a young Giant himself, was
the only one who could venture upon the liberty of waking his Father,
and I have already said what he got for his pains:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! not know thy Latin! After forty-eight years, seven
months, and two days, too! Then, my little rogue, it is to Paris thou
shalt go."</p>

<p>The trip to Paris being settled, the first
thing to be agreed on was a horse large
enough to carry Gargantua at his ease.
There was no trouble here; for, by good
luck, it happened that there had arrived,
only a few days before, the most gigantic
Mare that had ever eaten hay in the
Royal Stables. She had come all the
way from Africa, a present from Fayolles,
the fourth king of Numidia. When
Father Grandgousier went to look at the
Mare, he found her a marvellous animal,
indeed. She was as big as six elephants,
with her hoofs split into toes. Her ears hung downward like the great
ears of the goats of Languedoc. The mare was not alone in her split
toes, because history tells us that the steed of Julius Cæsar had the
self-same toes if he hadn't the ears. But she was alone in her tail!
Oh, how mighty that tail was! It was as big as the Pillar of Saint-Mars
near Langes, and just as square. If the boys and girls who are
reading this are surprised, they will only have to think of what they
have already read of the tails of those Scythian rams which weighed
more than thirty pounds each; and of the sheep of Syria, the tails of
which were so long and so heavy that they had to be rested on a cart
to be carried in comfort. The Mare, in short, was so extraordinary a
creature that, on seeing her for the first time, Father Grandgousier
could only whistle beneath his breath.</p>

<p>"That's the very beast to carry my son to Paris! With her, all
things will go well. He will be a great scholar <a id="one_of_these_days"></a>one of these days."</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA'S MARE.</div>
</div>

<p>The next day, after breakfast, the party started on their journey.
First, there was Gargantua on his gigantic mare, and wearing boots
which his father had just given him, made out of the skin of the red
deer; then his new teacher, Ponocrates; then his servants, among
whom was the young page, Eudemon. There never was a gayer
party. In the highest spirits,
and laughing loudly, they
jogged on, day after
day, until they
reached a point
just above the
City of Orleans.
At this point,
they found a
great forest thirty-five leagues long and seventeen wide, or thereabout.
The forest was very fertile in some ugly insects, known as gadflies
and hornets. These flies were so large and so fierce, and so sharp-tongued
and so poisonous besides, that they were the terror of all the
poor horses and asses which had to pass through the forest. But
Gargantua's Mare was equal to both flies and hornets. She resolved
to avenge all her kindred, even though they were mere dwarfs,
which had ever suffered from gadflies and hornets, and which, if she
did not help them, would continue to suffer from them. The
moment she got well into the forest, and the gadflies began to
plague her, she first shook her tail slowly and lazily to see
whether or not it was in good working order. This did not in the
least frighten the insects, which
kept on plaguing and stinging her
more than ever. Then it was
that she loosed that tail of hers
to the right and the left. So
well did she do this, whisking
it wildly here and there, far up
in the air and low down on the
ground, that she whipped down
the biggest trees, one after the
other, with a crash that made
the hearts of the others tremble
within their very bark, with all
the ease that a mower cuts down
the grass. So well did she do
her work that, since she passed
through that forest, there never
has been seen in it a single tree or
a single gadfly, or a single hornet,
for the whole wood on that day
became the open country, and has
been <a id="open_country_ever_since"></a>open country ever since.</p>

</div>

<p>When Gargantua, who hadn't
noticed what his Mare had been
doing, saw this, he only laughed,
while he said to Ponocrates in
his old-time French:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Je trouve beau-ce!</i>"</p>

<p>which, translated freely into English, would mean:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I find this fine."</p>

<p>And, from that day to this, the country above the City of
Orleans, in France, has been called <i>La Beauce</i>.</p>

<a id="STEALING_THE_GREAT_BELLS_OF_NOTRE-DAME"></a>STEALING THE GREAT BELLS OF NÔTRE-DÂME.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 197px;">
<img src="images/029.jpg" width="197" height="232" alt="Initial T" />
</div>

<p>The first thing Gargantua did, on reaching
Paris, was to make a resolve that
he and his people should have a gay
time. Some days after, when they had
all rested well and had feasted until
they were full of good eating and
drinking, Gargantua started on a stroll
through the town to find what was to
be seen. The Paris Gargantua saw was
not the Paris of to-day,&mdash;not nearly so
mighty a city as it has since become.
But its people then were every bit as
fond of merry-making and of seeing
shows as they are now. One who lived in those days, and who boasted
that he knew the Parisians better than they did themselves, says that
they were so silly and so stupid by nature that it only took a rope-dancer,
dancing on his rope, or a Merry-Andrew playing at his tricks,
or a bawler of old scraps, or a blind fiddler, or a hurdy-gurdy in the
market-place, to appear, to draw a bigger crowd than the holiest and
most eloquent preacher. Now, a Giant like Gargantua was himself
such a show as the people of Paris had never before set their silly eyes
on. Of course they swarmed around him with staring eyes and open
mouths, pushing against him here, and knocking against him there, in
their strong desire to see as much of him as they could. They troubled
him almost as much as the flies and hornets of <i>La Beauce</i> had troubled
his mare. Some, bolder than the rest, even ran in and out between his
legs as he strode along the street. At first, Gargantua took the crowd
good-naturedly enough. By and by, he began to think that all this
squeezing and tickling were getting just a little tiresome. He looked
around in a helpless sort of way, until, by good luck, his eyes fell on the
tall towers of <i>Nôtre Dâme</i> Cathedral, near by. "Ha! ha! that's the very
place for me," he cried, and, without further ado, resting one hand on
the top of the roof to steady himself, he went whizzing with a great
leap past the statues of Adam and Eve, that looked wonderingly out
from their stony niches. The idle crowd was afraid to follow Gargantua;
but it stood packed up close together in the open space which
surrounded the old church, gazing at him as he went through the air,
and wondering all the time what the Giant was going to do with their
famous towers. It was not long before they found out. No sooner
was he on the roof than Gargantua caught sight of the great tanks
filled with water which were then to be found there. Chuckling to
himself, he cried: "Now for some fun! I shall pledge this good people
of Paris in a glass of wine." Up he caught one of the tanks, poised it
for a moment in the air, and then shouting out: "<i>To your health, good
folks!</i>" tipped it just a bit. Down poured its water in a full stream.
Then he threw the tank after it. Quick, before one could think or
breathe, the others followed. So sudden was the down-pour of water
that the people thought a tremendous water-spout, in passing over their
city, had burst upon them. Two hundred and sixty thousand, four
hundred and eighteen persons were drowned on that day by the water,
or crushed by the tanks, or killed by being run over by those seeking
to escape. Those who were lucky got away as fast as they could. In
less than three minutes the square was empty, for the water, as it rolled
out into the streets, <a id="washed_all_the_dead_away"></a>washed all the dead away.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA ENTERS PARIS.</div>
</div>

<p>Gargantua, who was a good-hearted Giant, little knew what mischief
he had done. After he had emptied all the tanks, and thrown them
away, he ceased to think about the people. He had only gone on the
roof to rid himself of the buzzing and nudging of the crowd; and, not
hearing any more from them, he set about amusing himself. When he
caught sight of the great bells of <i>Nôtre Dâme</i>, a happy idea struck him.
He would set them to ringing and pealing! Ah, how he was charmed!
their notes were so soft, so rich, so mellow, so tender, so golden!
He wanted to have the bells about him all the time. Just then he
thought: "These Parisians deserve a lesson for their bad manners, and
I am going to revenge myself." So he at once began to pick up the
bells, one after the other, as if they were so many buckets. When he had
gathered them all, he leaped down from the roof and strode across the
city in the direction of his hotel. Once
there, a merry thought came to him,
which made him drop the bells and clap
his thighs with a sound that
brought all the good wives
of Paris&mdash;or those that remained
after the affair of
the tanks&mdash;to their windows.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho! I have it now!
I shall keep my beautiful bells to please my father, and pay the
Parisians, all at the same time. I send my mare home to-morrow.
Every little donkey nowadays wears a collar with jingling bells.
<i>My</i> Mare shall carry at her neck the bells of <i><a id="Notre_Dame"></a>Nôtre Dâme!</i>"</p>

<div class="caption">THE CITY WAS EXCITED.</div>
</div>

<p>Gargantua went straight to the stable where his Mare had already
found her fodder, and, with great care, while Gymnaste, his squire, held
the candle, placed the bells of <i>Nôtre Dâme</i>, one by one, around her
neck. The city was greatly excited at the loss of the bells; and, the
next day, there came a long line of grave, black-robed men who proved
to him in learned speeches that the holy church of <i>Nôtre Dâme</i> had a
right to her own bells. Gargantua, now that all the excitement had
passed, felt that he had done a very silly thing, and could only say that
the bells were not lost; but that if their worships would go to the stable,
they would find them still hanging from the neck of his great Mare.
After further talk, and much good drinking, the grave, black-robed
men&mdash;who, if the whole truth were to be told, were not a little afraid
of the Giant&mdash;picked up heart to say: "Give us back our bells, and
we shall bind ourselves to give your Mare free grazing in the forest of
Bière, so long as Your Highness honors us with your presence."</p>

<p>Gargantua was very willing to accept this offer. The bells were
taken back in great state to <i>Nôtre Dâme</i>, where&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;they
may be seen, and heard too, when the sun shines and when the
rain falls, to this very day.</p>

<p>Gargantua was a good son, as we
have already seen. He knew that he
had been sent to Paris to learn Latin.
So, after a few days of pleasure, he
dutifully offered to begin a course
of study with his new teacher, Ponocrates.
But Ponocrates himself
was just a little curious to know how
old Master Holofernes had managed
to teach his big pupil so as to leave
him, after fifty-three years, ten months,
and ten days, just as much a booby as
he had found him. "Let Your Highness,"
Ponocrates said, "do precisely as you used to do with your
old master." And Gargantua, greatly relieved, as you may imagine,
began to live in Paris the very life he used to live at home. And this
is the way he lived. He woke up between eight and nine o'clock every
morning, whether it was light or not. The first thing he did after
waking was to make a tent of the sheets of the bed, raising one of his
tall legs as the centre-pole and watching how the big sheet fell on
either side. After the tent was brought down, Gargantua would
begin to gambol and roll around in his bed, to stand on his head,
to twist his huge limbs in every sort of twirl, and to turn any
number of somersaults, single, double, treble, and quadruple, in
a way that would make one of our modern acrobats turn green
with envy. After that he would rise and dress himself according
to the season. But, in the old home days, he generally wore a
large robe of rough cloth, lined with fox-skins, and so he brought
out of his trunk the very garment itself, looking rather worn and shabby.
The next thing was to comb his head with a "German comb,"
which was the name given in those days to the easiest way of combing,
since it meant a comb made by the four fingers and the thumb. For
old Master Holofernes had always enjoined
this habit on him, saying that it
was a waste of time for him to smooth
his hair in any other way,
<a id="and_with_any_better_comb"></a>and with any better comb.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA GETS UP.</div>
</div>

<p>Being now
dressed, Gargantua
went through a series
of performances
which&mdash;considering
that they came
from a Giant&mdash;must
have been
very startling,
indeed. He
gaped, stretched,
coughed, spit,
groaned, sneezed,
hiccoughed, and
then, with a
broad smile, declared
himself
ready to breakfast
on fried
tripe, grilled steaks, colossal hams, magnificent roast, and a noble soup.
All this feast was made hot with mustard, shovelled down his throat
by four of his servants.</p>

<p>Master Ponocrates, one day, thought it his duty, as the teacher
charged with the education of his royal pupil, to suggest that it was
hardly right for him to eat so heavy a breakfast without having already
taken some exercise. Gargantua was ready with his answer.</p>

<p>"How can you say so, Master?" he asked; "have I not exercised
enough? Have I not stretched myself on the bed in all sorts of ways
until my muscles are sore? Isn't that enough? Pope Alexander the
V. used to do the same, by the advice of his Jewish doctor, and he
lived, as you know,
until he died. I feel
very well from
my breakfast,
and am
already

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA BREAKFASTS.</div>
</div>

<p>Ponocrates must have been satisfied
with this little speech of his pupil; for,
after grumbling a bit under his breath, all that he did was to stroke
his long beard in deep thought, while he asked himself in wonder:
"How did the Prince ever happen to hear about Pope Alexander?"
and let the young Giant continue his course, while he himself continued
to wonder.</p>

<p>After breakfast Gargantua went to church,&mdash;you may be sure he
kept away from <i>Nôtre Dâme!</i> Behind him, on his way to church,
went nine of the stoutest lackeys, who bore, as if they would have
liked to be doing anything rather than that, a big basket, which contained
a breviary worthy of a Giant, since it was so heavy that, by
actual weight, it was found to weigh just eleven hundred and six
pounds. With that breviary, the devout young Prince entered the
church and heard the Holy Mass from beginning to end. On leaving
the church, he always thought it the proper thing for his breviary to
be carried by oxen to his hotel. Once there, Gargantua began to
study during a short half hour, with his
eyes like good Saint Anthony's in the story,</p>

<p>The dinner came
soon enough after his
return home to satisfy
even Gargantua, who
was a great glutton.
He used to smile as
he saw the table at
his new lodging-house
laden with
a dozen rich
hams, with the
best of smoked
tongues, with
puddings, with;
fine chitterlings;
and his

took them all
down one after
the other.
Every day, after
the meals, it
was his practice
to wash his
hands with fresh wine, and to pick his teeth with a dry pig-bone.</p>

<p>The first thing Gargantua did, on rising
from the dinner table, would be to call
out in a cheery voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Spread the Carpet</span>!"</p>

<p>The servants understood what that
meant very well. Gaily they would unroll
a large carpet, stretch it free from
wrinkles, and then, in a twinkling, lay a
pack of cards in the very middle of it.
Then the Giant and his friends would sit
down on the carpet, and begin playing
cards. There were just two hundred
and fifteen of these games which Gargantua knew how to play.
Their names would sound odd to the card-players
of this day, and I give some of the oddest on the list, so that
you may know what queer games were then the fashion with the Giant
and his friends:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>Each of these games took a whole day, lasting between dinner and the
time to enjoy a nap. Gargantua always thought it necessary to prepare
for his afternoon sleep by taking a little drink. His companions
must have been heavy drinkers,&mdash;regular old topers of the jolly order,&mdash;because
the allowance every day called for eleven pots of wine for
each man. After drinking such a quantity they would naturally feel
drowsy. They would then stretch themselves on the carpet, and snore
away, each snorer playing a different tune through his nose, in the
midst of the cards lying loosely around, and the emptied pots,&mdash;all except
Gargantua, whose breathing on such occasions was always of
the hurricane fashion, whether awake or asleep. He would sleep for
two or three hours like a good Christian, without thinking of any evil
thing, and without muttering a single bad word in his dreams. On
waking, he had a trick of giving his great ears a half-dozen shakes,&mdash;why,
I don't know,&mdash;and then bawling out for fresh wine, which
he drank down in one great gulp. Then came the only study for
the day, which was rather a mystery for all parties. Nobody could
say exactly what it was, and Master Ponocrates only smiled when asked
about it. It lasted for a few minutes only, after which Gargantua
would mount, in high state, an old mule which had already served nine
kings, and briskly ride away to see where the good people of Paris
caught their rabbits.</p>

<p>On his return, he had a habit of running in and out of the kitchen,
with his broad nostrils swollen out like balloons, to find out what particular
roast was on the spit, until the cook, already in a stew, was ready
to tear his hair in despair. But cooks may be ever so vexed, the meat
will roast on the spit all the same, and at last get done to a turn. All
things being ready, Gargantua would sit down at table. He always
managed to have a large company of gentlemen present, who were only
too willing, for the honor of being invited to dinner by a Prince, to
serve as his attendants, should he ever need their services. Among
those of high birth who usually dined with him at this time were the
Lords De Fou, De Gourville, <a id="De_Grignaut_and_De_Marigny"></a>De Grignaut, and De Marigny.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA LOOKS INTO THE KITCHEN.</div>
</div>

<p>After supper, Gargantua&mdash;being in the liveliest humor, and disposed
to look on the world with a broad laugh, showing the largest
and whitest of teeth&mdash;would play a little, or else pay an open-air visit
to some of the many pretty young ladies living in the neighborhood,&mdash;their
houses being too small for him to enter,&mdash;and, on such nights, he
would not get home until midnight. Sometimes, when he did not go out,
he would take another little supper about eight o'clock, and still another
before midnight. Then he would sleep without snoring until eight
o'clock next morning.</p>

<p>It was a great day for Gargantua when he reached the end of his
two hundred and fifteen games; or, rather, he intended that it should
be a great day. He had said nothing to any one; but, when he woke
that particular morning, he was noticed to be in a gayer mood than
usual while he was dressing himself, and after he had gamboled
and rolled around his bed, and stretched his limbs on it, and made his
own great tent with one leg and the sheet, and given a neat turn to his
long locks with his German comb, and gone through his usual gaping,
coughing, spitting, groaning, sneezing, and hiccoughing. But, being in
some things a very simple Giant, indeed, he had not noticed that his
teacher, Ponocrates, had very keen eyes, and could use them too. Why,
Ponocrates knew when the last game was to be played just as well as Gargantua
himself did, and he had made up his mind to be somewhere in
the room when it closed. Sure enough, listening in a corner of the big
chamber, he heard some one say: "<i>Here we are on our last game!</i>" To
which Gargantua shouted in reply: "Ho! ho! The <i>last</i> game! Don't
be too sure of that. Gentlemen, to-morrow we shall play just as well
as to-day."</p>

<p>"How, Prince?" asked Ponocrates, softly, coming out of his
corner.</p>

<p>"How, good Master? Why, by beginning our games over again."</p>

<p>"Not so fast; not so fast, Prince. To-morrow Your Highness will
begin with <span class="smcap">Me</span>!"</p>

</div>

<p>While the two hundred and fifteen games,
taking up just that number of days,
were being played, Master Ponocrates
had not been at all idle. He had already
consulted with Master Theodore&mdash;a
wise physician of that time&mdash;and knew
just what he was going to do when he
had said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-morrow Your Highness will
begin with <span class="smcap">Me</span>."</p>

<p>The first thing was to dose Gargantua
with a mysterious herb, which made
him forget all that he had ever learned
under his old teacher. This was not an original idea at all with either
Theodore or Ponocrates, for Thimotes, the music-master of Miletus, had
long before dosed, in the same way, such disciples of his as had been
unlucky enough to have first learned their notes under other musicians.
Gargantua, when asked by Ponocrates to meet certain scientific gentlemen
of Paris who had been specially invited to inspire the royal Giant with
love of knowledge, was so weak and pale after his dose that he could
only bow his head, while wondering lazily to himself what all these
heavy talks about Science had to do with the Latin, which his good old
Father Grandgousier had been <a id="so_anxious_for_him_to_learn"></a>so anxious for him to learn.</p>

<div class="caption">PONOCRATES DOSES GARGANTUA.</div>
</div>

<p>When he had been dosed enough to forget his old studies, and
even to look up with a mild surprise when his dearly-loved Master
Holofernes was mentioned, Gargantua was put through a course of
study, in which he did not lose a single hour of the day. Only think
how much he must have learned each day! First, he was roused up,
whether he wanted or not, at four o'clock every morning, when he
said his prayers. While the attendants were rubbing his body down,
a young page would read, in a loud voice, so as to be heard above the
scrubbing, some extracts from a book of good doctrine. After this,
being not more than half-dressed yet, his practice was to visit each of
his companions in his room, and with a gentle "Get thee up, my boy!
get thee up!" awake the lazy fellow from his slumbers. Then he returned
to his room, where he found Ponocrates always ready to explain
what was doubtful in the chapters that had been
read to him, and to ask him whether he had
noted, as
he should,
what signs the sun was entering that
morning, and what aspect he thought the
moon would have that night.</p>

<p>It was only after this that his attendants began to dress him, to perfume
him, to curl him, and to powder him&mdash;Gargantua all the while
not once venturing to use that large, well-thumbed German comb of
which he had once been so proud. While all this was going on, the
same page would repeat the lesson of the day. Gargantua, thoroughly
dosed and brought down to a most anxious desire for study, learned
after two or three days to repeat the lessons by heart. Everybody
looked glad at this&mdash;none more so than good Master Ponocrates himself&mdash;especially
when the debate touched on such a question as the
"Human State," which was made the special lesson for two or three
hours. While Gargantua was still puzzling over the reading of the
"Human State," and learning all around the best talk about it, the big
clock would strike eleven; and then he would, with all his friends,
walk soberly to the ground where they would play at the good old
game of ball, exercising their bodies till all their muscles grew tired.
From the field it was an easy way to the house, where Gargantua,
being first rubbed down and after a change of shirt, would walk meekly,
surrounded by his friends, towards the kitchen to ask if the dinner was
ready. While waiting for the cook&mdash;now no longer in a stew, and
therefore growing fatter and greasier than ever&mdash;to send up the
meal, they would recite clearly and eloquently such sentences as had
been retained from the morning-lecture. However, Mister Appetite is
stronger than Knowledge; and when dinner was ready, they soon
dropped their wise talk and began to look with eyes as big as their
stomachs towards the dining-room. Once seated at table some one
would begin to read a pleasant history of ancient heroism, and continue
reading until the wine was served. Then, if the party seemed in a
mood for it, Ponocrates would set them to chatting merrily about the
nature of all that they had before them on the table, the bread, the
wine, the water, the salt, the meats, the fish, the fruits, herbs, roots
and the mode of preparing all these. Doing this every day, Gargantua
soon learned all the passages relating to them to be found in
old classic writers, who were as dry as they were wise. Sometimes,
when the quotation did not run smooth, the old, musty, yellow parchment
itself, with its nearly rubbed-out Gothic letters, would be brought
in to settle the question; and the result was that, in a marvelously
short time, no learned doctor was Gargantua's equal in all this&mdash;no,
<a id="not_by_one-half"></a>not by one-half.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA AT HIS LESSONS.</div>
</div>

<p>They would once more take up in an easy talk the lessons read
during the morning, and, after finishing their dinner with some well-made
marmalade of quinces, would clean their teeth with a twig of the
mastic tree, and wash their hands and eyes with fresh water. Which
being done, cards were brought, not to play with, but to teach a thousand
fresh tricks and inventions which sprang directly, not only from
Architecture, but from Geometry, Astronomy, and Music. After that,
with a word from the good Master, Gargantua would make himself
merry in singing with his comrades some songs selected by himself,
accompanied by such instruments as the lute, the spinet, the harp, the
German nine-holed flute, the viol, and the sackbut, when would come
three hours given to exercises in writing antique and Roman letters,
and, lastly, to the main study, which would have made old Father
Grandgousier's heart swell with gladness if he could only have
known it.</p>

<h4><a id="HOW_GARGANTUA_WAS_MADE_NOT_TO_LOSE_ONE_HOUR_OF_THE_DAY"></a>HOW GARGANTUA WAS MADE NOT TO LOSE ONE HOUR OF THE DAY.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 190px;">
<img src="images/040.jpg" width="190" height="223" alt="Initial E" />
</div>

<p>Everybody knows that Giants are very
queer people and require a great deal
of care, even when they are the mildest,
and Gargantua was such a Giant that
the measures of all the Tailors of Paris
at that time couldn't have told him how
tall he was, and all the weights known
in his day couldn't possibly have balanced
his big body.</p>

<p>Master Ponocrates, who had no
idea of making the Prince's mind strong
at the expense of his body,&mdash;being
too good a teacher for that,&mdash;arranged
it in such a way that, every day after the Latin lesson, Gargantua was
allowed, after changing his clothes, to leave his hotel with his Squire
Gymnaste, who had been chosen specially to teach him the noble art
of horsemanship. Once on horseback, Gargantua would first give his
steed full rein; then make him leap high in air; then jump a ditch; then
scale a fence; then turn quickly in one half of a circle, and back
again around the other half, before one could count thirty seconds.
Then calling for a lance&mdash;the keenest, the sharpest, and the strongest
that could be had&mdash;he would ride full-tilt against the heaviest door
or the stoutest oak, piercing the one through and through, or uprooting
the other by sheer force with as much ease as a common man would
tear up a sapling. As for the flourishes on horseback, no one could
compete with Gargantua. The great acrobat of Ferrara was only a
monkey in comparison with him. Gargantua was taught to leap from
one horse to another while both were at full gallop, without touching
the ground, or, with lance at rest, mounting each horse without
stirrup or bridle, and guiding it as he pleased. As Ponocrates said,
"all these things help to make a good soldier."</p>

<p>Yet this was only a trifle. Every fine day the Prince
would go hunting.
He would
shine as brightly
there as he had
done in horsemanship.
He
would always
be
the first
when the
chasing the deer, the doe, the boar, the partridge, the pheasant, and
the bustard.</p>

<p>Next to hunting came swimming. Gargantua, being so bulky,
never would strike a stroke unless he was in deep waters. He would
play such tricks in the water as only good swimmers know&mdash;swimming
on his back, or sideways, or with all his body, or sometimes with
his feet only. He laughed at the idea of crossing the Seine. It was
his daily pastime, holding a book with one hand high above the water,
to reach the other side without wetting a single page of it. One day,
Gargantua, being praised for all this, was asked if he had any model.
All he said was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Julius Cæsar used to do <a id="something_of_the_same_kind"></a>something of the same kind."</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA LEARNS TO SHOOT.</div>
</div>

<p>On coming out of the water, he would of course feel chilled through,
and then to get well warmed he would run up a hill, and then rush
down, taking the trees on the way, up which he would dart like a cat,
leaping from one branch to the other like a squirrel, and breaking
down great limbs to the right and left like Milo of old. He would
next pay his attention to the houses which, with the aid of two steel
poniards, he would climb, jumping down from them without ever being
the worse for it. After this he would exercise with the bow, often
strongest bows in drawing, shooting at
targets from below upwards, from above downwards,
sideways, and at last behind him, like
<a id="the_Parthians"></a>the Parthians.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA LEARNS TO CLIMB.</div>
</div>

<p>But there was something
more. Every day
after these feats were over,
they would drop a big cable
from some high tower to the
ground. Gargantua would
go hand over hand up
this chain, and descend
it with so sure a grip
that, among the active
men of Paris, there
could not be found his
equal. Then came
what Ponocrates called
strengthening his
nerves. For this purpose,
two great weights
of lead had been
specially made&mdash;each
one weighing eight
hundred and seventy
thousand pounds&mdash;which
Gargantua would take up, one in each hand, raise them above
his head, and keep them there, without moving, three quarters of an
hour and more. All who saw this great feat wondered, and swore that
the like of it had not been seen in the world. Being still out in the
open air, he would exercise his throat and his lungs by shouting like a
wild man. Why, he was one day heard calling Eudemon from the Gate
of Saint Victor, by a man who was standing in
the street at Montmartre,&mdash;any map of Paris
will show you how far that is. Everybody has
heard about Stentor and his great voice. Well,
Stentor never had such a voice at the siege of Troy as Gargantua
had at the gate of St. Victor.</p>

<p>When the weather was bright, he would play a game in which he
would imitate Milo, the famous strong man, by standing on his feet,
and daring any number of the strongest men to make him move. This
was the last of the hard work for the day. He would be allowed to
rest time enough to be bathed, rubbed down, and given clean clothes.
He and his companions would return very slowly home, stopping on
the way by certain fields or grassy plains, where they examined the
trees and plants, consulting over them with the books of old-time
greybeards who had written about them, their arms full of specimens
which they would throw to the page Rhizotome, who was charged to
take good care of them, together with the pickaxes, hoes, spades,
scrapers, pruning-knives, and other implements which his master had
used in the work.</p>

<p>Of course this had brought them home, where they had to wait
sometimes for supper. If they happened to wait, they would repeat
certain passages from what had been read or spoken of at dinner.
At the supper-table, they would continue their wise talk. After supper
they used to sing musically, to play on harmonious instruments, and
to pass the time away in those little games which wise men know how
to play with cards, dice, and goblets. His companions never found
these very interesting. <a id="No_more_did_Gargantua"></a>No more did Gargantua.</p>

<p>When bed-time came, Gargantua used to walk with Ponocrates as
far as the lodge, looking upon the open street, whence they could
better see the face of the sky. There he watched the comet&mdash;there
happened to be one then&mdash;and the figure, situation and aspect, opposition
and conjunction of the stars. Then, with his good teacher, he
would briefly sum up in the way of the Pythagoreans all that he had
read, seen, known, thought, and done in the course of the day.</p>

<p>Then the tired young Giant, tucking his bedclothes lazily around
him, would commend himself to Heaven, and stretch his big limbs out
on a bed that I am afraid was rather short for him.</p>

<h4>HOW THE AWFUL WAR BETWEEN THE BUNMAKERS OF LERNE AND
<a id="GARGANTUAS_COUNTRY_WAS_BEGUN"></a>GARGANTUA'S COUNTRY WAS BEGUN.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 193px;">
<img src="images/044.jpg" width="193" height="224" alt="Initial W" />
</div>

<p>While Gargantua, studying day after day,
was finding out that the tasks he had at
first thought to be so hard were so easy
that they became more a pastime than
anything else, and while he was growing
to be a skilful soldier and a most
learned gentleman, his old father, King
Grandgousier, without his knowing it,
had got into a terrible muss with certain
Bunmakers of Lerne.</p>

<p>This is how it happened.</p>

<p>It was vintage-time, when the great
purple grapes, bursting with their ripeness,
were to be gathered, and when the Shepherds of Grandgousier's
kingdom used to watch the vines like hawks to prevent the starlings
from pecking at the juicy clusters. This vintage-time always made
business for the Bunmakers of Lerne. Even when in the best of
humor, however, they were always a peppery-touch-me-if-you-dare
sort of fellows. They brought their buns to market along the great
highway, in ten or eleven big carts, which filled the air around them
with the sweetest odors. Of course, trudging along through the white
dust of the road, they were sure to meet King Grandgousier's Shepherds
watching their vines, who always made it a rule to step out
politely to the edge of the highway, hats in hand, to beg the Bunmakers
to give them some of their fine, smoking buns in exchange for
their money.</p>

<p>I dare say the Shepherds knew what they were doing. Never
were there such buns as the Bunmakers of Lerne had the fame, all
around that region, of making. Taken at breakfast with ripe grapes
they were a dish fit for a King's table!</p>

<p>By ill luck, this year above all other years, the Bunmakers chose
to show how hot and peppery they could be. Being asked by the
Shepherds in the usual polite way to sell their buns, they not only
refused outright, but they began to call the honest Shepherds all the
bad names they could think of. There was one Shepherd named
Forgier,&mdash;a good man, and a gay one besides,&mdash;who, stepping forward,
said in a mild voice <a id="to_the_Bunmakers"></a>to the Bunmakers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;">
<img src="images/045.jpg" width="470" height="199" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE BUNMAKERS OF LERNE.</div>
</div>

<p>"Friends, this is not acting like neighbors. Haven't you always
come by the highway?
Haven't you always found us ready to give you good
silver and copper for your buns? And haven't you
always had from us in return our fine cheeses, which give their richness
to your buns?"</p>

<p>It is an old saying that oil will make troubled waters still. But
old sayings are not always true. This particular saying proved false,
for, when the Bunmakers received Forgier's oil, it only set <i>their</i> water
on fire. "Come here, sirrah!" shouted Marquet, the chief Bunmaker,
to Forgier, "and <i>I</i> will give you your buns."</p>

<p>Forgier, being a very worthy, unsuspecting fellow, came near
with his money in his hand, like an honest man, thinking all the time
that Marquet really would let him have the buns, in spite of his rough
voice and sneering tones. What did Marquet do but, with his long
whip, cut the good Forgier about his body and legs so as to make him
dance more nimbly than he had
ever danced before! After that,
Marquet got a little frightened and
wanted to slip away; but Forgier, while
he was bawling for everybody to come
to his rescue, took from under his arm
a big cudgel, with which he
hit the bad Bunmaker such a
blow on his head as
to make him fall
from his horse more
like a dead man than a
living one.</p>

<p>But this was not
the end. The good
Shepherds, hearing
Forgier's cries for help,
rushed from their
grape-vines to the white, dusty road, holding their poles in their hands
ready to avenge their comrade. The Bunmakers, peppery as they
might be, were just then trying to get off as fast as their horses
could carry their carts away; but they were not fast enough to prevent
the Shepherds from taking from them four or five dozen delicious
buns, for which they offered, like honest men, to pay the usual price.
But the Bunmakers were in too great a hurry for that. They laughed
angrily at all these offers, and bore Marquet's body, in a dead faint,
away with them.</p>

<p>And this was how the great and bloody war between the Bunmakers
of Lerne and Gargantua's country began.</p>

<p>The first thing the Bunmakers did, on getting safe home at Lerne,
even before taking a bit of food or a sup of wine, was to hasten to
the palace, where, bowing low before their King Picrochole, they
spread out their broken baskets, torn robes, crushed buns, and, at last,
with a grand flourish, displayed Marquet himself all covered with dry
blood, and groaning dreadfully.</p>

<p>"Who has dared do this?" shouted King Picrochole, getting very
<a id="red_in_the_face"></a>red in the face.</p>

<div class="caption">THE ANGER OF PICROCHOLE.</div>
</div>

<p>"The Shepherds and vine-watchers of that old Giant Grandgousier,
may it please Your Majesty," answered the Bunmakers.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" roared Picrochole furiously.</p>

<p>Without asking for further information or a single proof, Picrochole
ordered the drum to be beat around his city, commanding everybody,
under pain of the halter, to appear at broad noon in the great
square. Then he went to dinner. While he was dining, he gave out
his commissions to his officers in the army, which, when gathered together,
was found to consist of sixteen thousand and fourteen bowmen,
and thirty thousand and eleven infantry. To the great Equerry Touquedillon
was given the command of the artillery, which, when mustered,
numbered nine hundred and fourteen great brass cannon, culverins,
catapults, and <a id="other_pieces_of_artillery"></a>other pieces of artillery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/047.jpg" width="456" height="335" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">CAPTAIN SWILLWIND'S CAVALRY.</div>
</div>

<p>When the army was all got together, a troop of Light Cavalry, three
hundred strong, under Captain Swillwind, was sent forward to scour
the country of the enemy, and find out what ambuscades had been laid;
but they could find none. Grandgousier's Shepherds were still peacefully
watching their grape-vines, and looking out only for the bad starlings.
When the report was made that the land was clear, Picrochole,
all of a sudden bold, ordered a quick advance, each company marching
under its own captain. Without any order or discipline, the army swept
over King Grandgousier's fields, meeting no opposition; laying them
waste; sparing neither rich nor poor; respecting no holy
place; carrying away the bellowing oxen, mooing cows,
roaring bulls, crying calves,
bleating lambs, ewes, rams,
goats, cackling hens, crowing
cocks, piping chicks, goslings, ganders, geese, grunting swine, and
suckling pigs; beating down the ripe walnuts; tearing up the vines,
and pulling all the fruit from the trees. Now and then, a frightened
Shepherd would crawl from his hiding-place and beg for mercy, on the
ground that he and the Bunmakers had always been the best neighbors
together, and that it would be a shame to treat him like a foe. All
the Bunmakers did was to laugh at so mean-spirited a fellow, while
shouting that they were bound to teach him how to eat their buns.
So, like a great wave of blood, they rolled on till they reached Seuilly.
Then the mighty army, after sacking the town, rushed, shouting like
madmen, to the very walls of the great and venerable Abbey of Seuilly,
which they found very thick, and strengthened by a huge gate made
fast against them. The main body marched away towards the Ford of
Vede, leaving seven bodies of infantry with their standards, and two
hundred lancers, to break down the wall, which they did very soon,
with fierce cries of "Let us <a id="spoil_the_monks"></a>spoil the monks!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
<img src="images/048.jpg" width="423" height="450" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">SPOILING THE MONKS.</div>
</div>

<p>Of course, the poor monks were not
fighting men. And when they found their
convent walls broken through and their
fields at the mercy of the Bunmakers, all
they could think of doing was to go to their Chapel,
from which they intended to come forth in a solemn
procession to entreat the wicked men to leave them
alone. While the monks, headed by their Prior
himself, were singing psalms and getting ready to leave the Chapel, in
rushed a young monk, with flaming eyes, who had seen what was going
on in the vineyard.</p>

<p>"That's very well sung, brethren!" he shouted; "very well sung,
indeed! But why don't you sing, 'Good-by, basket, the vintage is
over'? Don't you know that those fellows are breaking down our
vines, and that we shall have no good wine this year?"</p>

<p>Now this young monk, who was called Friar John, was, I am
afraid, looked upon by his pious brethren as rather a black sheep. He
was tall, straight as an arrow, strong as a bull, a little quick of speech,
skilful in all games, and as brave as a lion. So, when he looked in
upon the singing monks, and found them ready to give up everything,
off came his frock, and catching up a great staff near by, which
was as long as a lance and as big around as the fist, he rushed out and
fell upon the enemy, who were thinking of everything save the praying
monks in the Abbey. The flag-bearers had piled their flags all
along the walls to work the better, the drummers had opened one end
of their drums and stuffed them with grapes, and the very trumpets
<a id="were_running_over_with_juice"></a>were running over with juice.</p>

<div class="caption">FRIAR JOHN ATTACKS THE BUNMAKERS.</div>
</div>

<p>Then it was that Friar John&mdash;holding his staff high in the air&mdash;swept
down upon the scattered Bunmakers like a hurricane! It was
"first come, first served" with Friar John. The first thwack crashed
through the crown of a big-headed bun-man, and brought him down.
Then the staff, with just a little blood on it now, went spinning around
to the right and left&mdash;up and down, first on one, then another&mdash;in
fact, everywhere. It broke the legs of this one, the arms of that one,
and the neck of still another. It gouged the eyes, drove teeth down
throats, smashed in ribs, and made jaws crack. If any one wanted to
hide between the thick vines, Friar John was sure to spy him out and
bring him to the ground with a broken back. If any one wanted to
run away, the terrible staff would reach him, and he would fall, shouting:
"I surrender!" When the slaughter had gone on for some time,
Friar John stopped, and for good reason; for, looking around him,
he could no longer see a single Bunmaker standing on his feet,
and he was only giving wild blows in the air. Then he rested,
and it was found that he had, with his single arm, killed the whole
army which had remained behind in the vineyards of the convent, numbering
thirteen thousand six hundred and twenty-two men. But
Friar John had struck down some other things besides the army, and
these were the purple vines loaded with the rich and juicy grapes,
which made the delicious convent wine famous throughout all the land.</p>

<p>After all, the rascal Bunmakers <i>had</i> <a id="spoiled_the_vintage"></a>spoiled the vintage!</p>

</div>

<p>While Friar John was cracking skulls, and
breaking limbs, and flattening noses, and
ramming teeth down throats, Picrochole,
King of Lerne, had, with his Bunmakers
and in the greatest haste, crossed the
Ford of Vede and ordered the town of
Roche-Clermaud to surrender, which did
not make him wait long before opening
its gates to him. We shall leave him
there while we see how King Grandgousier
had received the news of this
sudden war.</p>

<p>One rainy evening, the fine old gentleman
happened to be in a very good humor. He was, as usual after
supper, seated warming his knees, which were somewhat rheumatic,
before a blazing fire; and, while waiting for the chestnuts to be roasted
to a turn, was passing the time by writing on the red hearth with a
burnt stick and making Queen Gargamelle laugh by telling his funny
stories of old times. While he was in the very midst of one of these
funny old stories, and the chestnuts were smelling as if they wanted to
be eaten, here comes a servant to tell King Grandgousier that one of
his Shepherds was down in the court-yard begging to see him.</p>

<p>"What does the varlet want?" asked the old King. He didn't mean
to be angry, but his surprise made his big voice sound very loud and
very gruff.</p>

<p>"To see Your Majesty."</p>

<p>"And what does he want to see My Majesty for? But bring him
up. I shan't know any sooner by waiting for thee to tell me."</p>

<p>Who should it be but one of the very Shepherds, who had been
watching the vines and the rich purple grapes when the trouble began?
He was full of it,&mdash;so brimming full that he could hardly speak for his
eagerness to tell all he knew. At last, he managed to let the King
know what the bad Bunmakers of Lerne had done with his subjects'
vineyards; how the wicked King Picrochole had been running over his
lands, doing pretty much what he liked in the way of burning houses,
sacking towns, and tramping down vines; and how he was, just at
this time, shutting the gates of Roche-Clermaud <a id="against_His_Majesty"></a>against His Majesty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/051.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">PICROCHOLE'S ARMY.</div>
</div>

<p>It was sad to see how the old Giant received this bad news. He
was the kindest and friendliest of neighbors to all the Kings around
him. He had never been known to go to war with any of them, and no
neighbor had ever once thought before of going to war with him.
What the good old man liked was peace, so that he could, every day
after supper, eat roasted chestnuts, and tell fine stories of old times,
while writing with a burnt stick on the red hearth.</p>

<p>"<i>Holos! holos!</i>" cried Grandgousier; "what is all this, good
people? Am I dreaming? Or is this really true that I hear? Can
Picrochole, the dear friend of my youth, close to me in blood and alliance,
mean to war against me and my people?
Who leads him on? Who
has induced him to do
this? Ho! ho!
ho! ho! ho! May
he believe me
when I say
that I have
never done
any harm
to him or
his people!
On the
contrary,
I have
helped him
whenever
he wanted
money;
and that
was very
often. Ho! ho
ho! my good
people, my
friends, and all
my faithful servants,
I cannot
prevent your coming to my aid. <i>Las!</i> I am getting old. All my
life I have worked for peace. Now I must have war. <i>Las! Las!</i>"</p>

<p>While saying all this, he roared in his despair, without knowing it,
so fiercely that the chestnut-roasters ran away in their fright, leaving
their chestnuts to pop and burn on the griddles. Only the Council remained,
who always made it a point to be present at supper. King
Grandgousier at once called the Council together for special deliberation,
by inviting them to sit at the supper-table without eating, and
talk about affairs. After three hours of close debate, two points were
fully agreed on:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To send an army to Picrochole to treat about matters.</p>

<p>2. To write to Prince Gargantua.</p>

<p>It was further resolved to send Ulrich Gallet, the very next day,
with five carts full of buns, with instructions to tell Picrochole that the
old King was willing to give these <i>five cart-loads</i> of buns to make
good those <i>five dozen buns</i> which had been <a id="taken_by_his_Shepherds"></a>taken by his Shepherds.</p>

<div class="caption">GRANDGOUSIER WRITES TO GARGANTUA.</div>
</div>

<p>Then Grandgousier wrote a letter to Gargantua, telling about the
war on his hands, in which he said: "My resolve is not to provoke,
rather to pacify; but, if assailed, to defend myself. Come, my Gargantua,
my well-beloved, come! Thy Father wants thee!"</p>

<p>By this time the chestnuts were all burnt black, and there wasn't
a single spark to be seen among the ashes.</p>

</div>

<p>King Picrochole must have been a very
mean man. You will begin to think so
when you know how he treated Ulrich
Gallet, who was sent by good old Father
Grandgousier to make peace. Ulrich
left the palace with five cart-loads of
splendid buns, four of these carts being
for the Bunmakers, and the fifth and last
cart being filled to the brim with buns
good enough to make any one's mouth
water, being made of the purest butter,
the most delicious honey, the freshest
eggs, and the richest saffron and other
spices ever known. As Ulrich went along the high-road, people would
curl up their noses in delight, take two or three long sniffs, and then
cry out: "Ah! that last cart is the best of all."</p>

<p>"Yes," Ulrich would answer; "the buns in that cart are sent
by King Grandgousier to Marquet himself."</p>

<p>"Who is Marquet?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know that he is the man who struck our friend
Forgier across the shins and got beaten by our Shepherds? His Majesty
has given me seven hundred thousand and three gold crowns for him to
pay the surgeon who nursed his wounds."</p>

<p>"Oh! how good a King we have!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and, what is more, His Majesty offers to give Marquet and
his heirs an apple-orchard forever, so dearly does he love peace."</p>

<p>"Was there ever such a King as ours!" cried the people on the
road, sending Ulrich on with another cart-load of blessings for each
mile, so that by the time he reached King Picrochole's Court there
must have been <a id="quite_a_train_of_carts"></a>quite a train of carts.</p>

<div class="caption">GRANDGOUSIER'S EMBASSY.</div>
</div>

<p>When Ulrich got near Roche-Clermaud, he began to fear that he
wouldn't be allowed to get into it unless he could first show that he
and his carts were the best of friends. So, just before reaching the
limits, he placed all around his carts a great store
of reeds, canes, and willow-boughs, and took
good care to have every one of the drivers decorated
with the same, which made them look
very friendly, indeed. So great was
Ulrich's desire to appear like a
friend that he even held a branch
of each in his own hand. At
this sight, the people of Lerne did not curl up their noses
with quite so much delight, nor take quite so many sniffs,
as the good Shepherds who had already been enjoying the fragrance of
the buns. But, without minding cross words and sour looks, Master
Ulrich Gallet at last reached the gates of King Picrochole's Palace.</p>

<p>Picrochole did not want either to let him come in, or go out
to meet him, but sent word to him, instead, to tell what he had to
say to Captain Touquedillon. Then the good man, clearing his throat,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, to take away all cause for any further trouble, and to
remove any excuse for your master and mine not becoming once more
the best of friends, I have brought with me the buns about which all
this trouble began. Our people took from yours five dozen buns.
Good!&mdash;your people were well paid for them. We love peace so
dearly that we bring you five carts full of buns for the five dozen which
we took. One of these is for Marquet, and, besides that, here are
seven hundred thousand and three gold crowns for him, and also a deed
to him and his heirs forever of one of our best apple-orchards. Let us
live in peace hereafter, and do you return to your own country and
leave this city, to which you have no right, as you yourself know."</p>

<p>Now, this Captain Touquedillon was a snakish sort of man; and
when he heard honest Ulrich talk he went straight to Picrochole, and
coiled and twisted what he had heard in such a way that poor Ulrich,
could he have heard it, wouldn't have known it to be his own. The
snakish Captain added that they had got into a trap in Roche-Clermaud,
and that those five carts had come in the very nick of time for
the starving soldiers.</p>

<p>"You say well," cried Picrochole, "seize the buns the rascal has
brought!"</p>

<p>"And the money?"</p>

<p>"Seize that too!"</p>

<p>Then Captain Touquedillon, without further ado, sent his men out
of the gate to take the money, the buns, the oxen, and the carts.</p>

<p>Good Ulrich returned to Grandgousier, and told him all these
things. This made the gentle old Giant very sad. He stopped telling
stories of old times, and took no more pleasure in roasted chestnuts.
He saw that there must be a war, and a bitter one. He ceased to talk,
and was always sighing. All that he ever would say, after long hours
of silence and sighs, was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho, there! Has my boy Gargantua come yet?"</p>

<h4>HOW GARGANTUA, WITH A BIG TREE, BROKE DOWN A CASTLE AND PASSED
THE FORD OF VEDE.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 190px;">
<img src="images/055.jpg" width="190" height="226" alt="Initial G" />
</div>

<p><a id="Gargantua_was_a_good_son_if"></a>Gargantua was a good son if ever there
was one. The minute he read his
Father's letter begging him to come
home, he ordered his great Mare to be
bridled and saddled. It was less than
thirty minutes after this that he was galloping
on the road along with wise old
Ponocrates, his faithful Squire Gymnaste,
and the pretty little page Eudemon.
This certainly was not a very
strong escort, but Gargantua's single
arm was worth an army.</p>

<p>The servants followed slowly with
his baggage, books, and philosophical instruments.</p>

<p>Having got as far as Parillé, they were told how Picrochole had
taken Roche-Clermaud, and how his men had been robbing and pillaging
everywhere, and had been frightening everybody so much that
nobody was brave enough to tell on them. Another piece of news
Gargantua heard at Parillé. This was that one of Picrochole's fiercest
officers, Captain Tripet, had been sent to take possession of several
points near the Ford of Vede.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho!" cried Gargantua. "Let us ride, then, as fast as
we can to the Ford of Vede."</p>

<p>"No, Prince," said Ponocrates; "what I would advise you to do is
to ride on a few miles farther, to the house of the Lord of Vauguyon.
He is an old friend of your royal Father, and can give us better counsel
than we can get in this place."</p>

<p>"Well, then, so be it," said Gargantua.</p>

<p>The whole party galloped swiftly to Vauguyon, where they were
received with open gates and a steaming supper. After wine had been
drunk, and the Lord of Vauguyon had settled down to talk, Gargantua
was told that all that had been said was true. Picrochole's soldiers
were both at Roche-Clermaud and the Ford of Vede. On hearing this,
the Prince would not wait to sleep, so anxious was he to rush to the
help of his good old Father. The Lord of Vauguyon tried to keep
him in the Castle until after a great storm, which then threatened, was
over. It was of no use, Gargantua would hear nothing.</p>

<p>"To your saddles, gentlemen!" he
cried. "It is at the Ford we shall hunt
<a id="Picrocholes_mannikins"></a>Picrochole's mannikins!"</p>

<img src="images/056.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">GARGANTUA HURRIES HOME.</div>
</div>

<p>Once more
mounted on his
great Mare he started for the Ford. His lips were pressed close,
and his eyes glared fiercely down from a height greater than that
of the tallest trees. "His Highness is very angry," Ponocrates
whispered to Gymnaste. (For the first time he was afraid of his
pupil.) "His Highness is awful mad," Gymnaste whispered to
Eudemon. On getting near the Ford, what should Gargantua do but
tear up a fine and stately tree which he found growing by the roadside,
stripping its branches and leaves till he made it a bare pole of
enormous length and strength. "Just what I have been looking for!"
he said to himself; "this tree will serve me both as staff and lance."</p>

<p>All this was being done under a fearful tempest of rain. The
storm had burst, as the Lord of Vauguyon had foreseen. Ponocrates
could hardly sit on his horse, for the heavy drops fell like so much
lead; dainty little Eudemon was quite crushed, and
could only keep himself from falling by clasping his
horse's neck; and all Gymnaste could do to keep his
spirits up and his blood warm
was, every now and then, to
turn somersaults on the back
of his horse, stand on his head,
on the tip of his thumb, and
skip from side to
side like a monkey.
All this
time Gargantua,
seated on his great
Mare, did not feel
the rain any more than if it was not roaring and hissing around him, filling
all the streams along the road, and making <a id="a_deluge_around_the_Ford"></a>a deluge around the Ford.</p>

<p>He was soon to see, however, that if he himself, being a Giant,
could stand this sudden flood, smaller men could not. The first thing
he heard on going a little farther, from some people who were running
to the high grounds for safety, was that the Ford was all swollen, and
that thousands of men had been drowned in it.</p>

<p>He could not understand this,&mdash;of course he could not, being a
Giant,&mdash;but what he did understand better was what that sly little
page Eudemon, who had galloped ahead to get shelter from the rain,
told him. The news Eudemon brought was that Picrochole's men were
in a Castle this side of the Ford, and that before his master could hope
to reach it he must take the Castle, or they
<a id="would_take_him"></a>would take him.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CASTLE OF ROCHE-CLERMAUD.</div>
</div>

<p>In a little while they
came near the Castle.
The
great, gloomy building
seemed deserted. Not a face
was to be seen either from window
or turret. Riding alone to
the front of it, Gargantua shouted
out at the top of his voice to those inside:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you there, or are you not? If you are there, don't stay!
If you are not there, I shall have all this trouble for nothing."</p>

<p>All the answer a bold cannoneer, who had not been seen, and who
was watching behind the ramparts, gave, was, after taking aim point-blank,
to fire his cannon off, the ball furiously striking Gargantua on
the right temple, but for all that <a id="not_hurting_him_in_the_least"></a>not hurting him in the least.</p>

<div class="caption">CANNONADING GARGANTUA.</div>
</div>

<p>"What is that?" he shouted. "How, are those fellows throwing
grape-seeds at us? If they are, the harvest will cost them dear," thinking
that the balls were only grape-seeds.</p>

<p>On hearing his words&mdash;they could have been heard a mile off&mdash;those
in the Castle rushed pell-mell to the towers and ramparts, and
fired more than nine thousand and twenty-five shots from their falcons
and arquebuses, aiming each shot straight at Gargantua's head, which
towered high above the ramparts. The guns were well pointed, and
the balls hit the Giant so often that they began to bother him.</p>

<p>"Look here, Ponocrates, my friend," he called to Ponocrates, who
had just come up; "these flies are blinding my eyes! Jump down,
please, and get me the biggest branch you can find to drive them
away."</p>

<p>All this time, he was fully convinced that the leaden balls and the
big stones hurled from the artillery <a id="were_so_many_flies"></a>were so many flies.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA DESTROYS THE CASTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>Giants are always very hard-headed, and sometimes as simple as
they are hard-headed. Ponocrates, who knew better than that, told
him what it was that was falling around him. Then, for the first time,
Gargantua got really mad. He raised his big tree in proper position,
and, turning the head of his Mare well towards the Castle, rushed furiously
against the walls, tearing down all the towers and buttresses, and
laying them in ruins on the ground. Not one of all those in the Castle,
who had been laughing and making Gargantua their target from the
ramparts, escaped. Paying no more attention to the ruins he went
on to the mill-bridge, and found all the Ford, swollen by the rain, covered
over with corpses, and in such number that the dead bodies had
actually caused the water of the mill to stop running. Standing on
the bank the party waited a bit, not at all liking to ride over dead men.
That skipping monkey, Gymnaste, was the first to cross. He loudly
swore that his horse was afraid of nothing, and that at home the beast
never could get his feed without first stepping over a stuffed body,
always put for that purpose in his way.</p>

<p>This satisfied the others, who soon crossed after Gymnaste, and
Gargantua and his great Mare slowly followed, last of all.</p>

<p>Grandgousier's Palace was not far
from the Ford. In a very short time
after leaving the river Gargantua galloped
into the court-yard, where he was
joyfully welcomed by the old King
himself. You may imagine how he
laughed, and then cried, and then
laughed once more, loud and long,
over his big son, for whom he had been
so anxiously waiting. But the laughter
lived after the tears. A queer thing
happened after everybody had got
comfortably seated. Gargantua, feeling
a little warm after his ride, had already washed himself and put
on some clean clothes, for he had learned to be a neat man ever
since Ponocrates had given him that mysterious dose. He was now
combing his thick hair, in a lazy sort of a way, with his own comb,
which had been specially made in Africa for the young Prince on his
tenth birthday. It was very large,&mdash;larger, in fact, than any comb that
had ever before passed through a Giant's hair. Each tooth was an
elephant's tusk, taken just as it had stood in the elephant's jaw. Every
time Gargantua passed the comb through his locks, half a dozen of those
balls which had stuck there when he was going through the wood of
Vede would drop on the floor with a clattering noise.</p>

<p>The amazement of good Father Grandgousier, who had his glasses
off and was nearly blind without them, when he heard these cannon-balls
tumbling down from his son's head on the floor, was <a id="something_worth_seeing"></a>something
worth seeing.</p>

<div class="caption">GARGANTUA COMBS HIS HAIR.</div>
</div>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho! my good son, hast thou brought fleas all this way
from Paris? Didst thou think we had none of our own here?"</p>

<p>When Gargantua, on looking down, saw several balls at his feet,
he did not know what to say. He had not felt them, and was even
more puzzled than his father. But wise Master Ponocrates was always
ready to give the best answer,
in the best place, and
in the wisest way,
to any question
asked. Stooping
and picking up
one of the
balls, he said,
bowing respectfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This,
Your Majesty,
is one of the
cannon-balls which
your son, while he was
passing the wood of Vede, received through the treachery of your
enemies."</p>

<p>"So that's it, is it?" cried Father Grandgousier. "Oh! the
audacious vermin, to try and shoot my only son! Ho! ho! I hope
not one of the rascals was allowed to escape."</p>

<p>"All of them," answered Ponocrates solemnly, "perished in
the ruins."</p>

<p>"That is just as it should be," the old King said. "Now, my
lords, to supper!"</p>

<p>There never was a supper so soon ready! For, when the order
had been first given, the three Very Fat Cooks&mdash;Snapsauce, Hotchpotch,
and Braverjuice&mdash;all came forward gravely, and with their
right hands on their hearts swore they would soon have the finest
supper that had ever been eaten, even in the Palace which was famed
throughout the world for the perfection of its feasts.</p>

<p>And such a supper as they did make!</p>

<p>When the Chief Cook Snapsauce was asked for an account of what
he had sent up, here is the list he gave, all the while strutting like a
turkey-cock; and he was just as red as one, too, as he read it,&mdash;so
full of pride and of the kitchen-fire was he:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sixteen roasted beeves,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Three heifers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thirty-two calves,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sixty-three kids,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ninety-five sheep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Two hundred and twenty partridges,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seven hundred snipe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Four hundred capons of Loudunois,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Six thousand pullets,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The same number of pigeons,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Six hundred young, but specially fat, pullets,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fourteen hundred young hares,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Three hundred and three bustards.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Besides these domestic birds and beasts there were to be found at this
wonderful feast, eleven wild boars, kindly sent by the good Abbé de
Turpenay; eighteen red deer, the gift of the Lord of Grandmont;
one hundred and forty pheasants, from the Lord of Essars; and such a
number of nice things in the shape of turkeys, birds, ducks, wild geese,
swans, varied by the best vegetables that could be found, the country
round, as had never been known to be brought together <a id="on_the_same_table"></a>on the same
table.</p>

<div class="caption">AND SUCH A SUPPER!</div>
</div>

<p>I have not yet told something that took place a little while before
this great supper. While all were waiting for it, Gargantua suddenly
cried out: "Ho! I feel dreadfully thirsty! Somebody bring me a
lettuce."</p>

<p>Father Grandgousier,
well pleased
to grant whatever his
son asked, but wanting
to see him work
a little for his own
pleasure, answered
him gaily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are some
very fine lettuces growing in yonder garden, my
boy. If thou wantest them the best thing thou canst do is to seek
them thyself. Thou canst find none so tall as they in all this country."</p>

<p>Sure enough, when Gargantua walked into the garden he found
lettuces of all sizes; some as high as plum-trees, and others again quite
as tall as walnut-trees. He cut and whacked away at his will, and
picked them up in his big arms, without, for a moment, troubling himself
about what might be hidden in them. Now, it happened that six
pilgrims, who, in coming all the way from St. Sebastian, had decided
to rest for the night, had chanced, unfortunately, to be taking a quiet
little nap between the cabbages and lettuces of the Royal Garden.
When they were snatched up by Gargantua along with the lettuces, the
poor pilgrims, only half-awake, were so frightened that they didn't
dare even cough, <a id="much_less_say_a_word"></a>much less say a word.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/063.jpg" width="400" height="330" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE PILGRIMS IN THE GARDEN.</div>
</div>

<p>Gargantua, being a fine, hearty fellow, was rather pleased with the
idea of waiting on himself, and so, after carrying his lettuces to the
fountain, he thought he might as well wash them, while his merry old
father looked on, laughing at the joke. All this time the pilgrims,
being half-drowned and in an awful fright, were whispering softly
whenever they could get a chance to do so, one to the other:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! what is this monster going to do with us? What is to become
of us? That fountain is drowning us among all these lettuces!
Shall we speak? But, if we say a word, that big fellow will kill us all
as spies, sure. Oh! we are undone!"</p>

<p>While the pilgrims were thus giving way to their fears, Gargantua
would, every now and then, whirl them around in the water along with
his lettuces. Then he put the mess, just as it stood, into the biggest
dish in the royal household, adding oil and vinegar and salt, and mixed
them all well together. He had no sooner done so than he began to
eat the lettuces, and, of course, with the lettuces, to gobble up the poor
pilgrims. He had already taken five of them. The sixth was still in
the great dish hidden away under a lettuce and, what from the water,
and what from fear, was in a cold sweat. All that appeared of him
was his pilgrim's staff, which he had never stopped clutching and which
peered outside of the green herbs. When Father Grandgousier saw
the staff, he cried out to Gargantua:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do believe that is a snail's horn under that lettuce! Don't
eat it."</p>

<p>"Why not, father?" answered Gargantua; "thou knowest snails
are good all this month."</p>

<p>What should he do then but draw out the staff and, with it, the
unhappy pilgrim, whom, without seeing,&mdash;or, for that matter, feeling,&mdash;he
swallowed with the greatest ease! Then he poured down his great
throat a horrible draught of country wine, while saying: "That salad
has given me a famous appetite! Is supper ready?"</p>

<p>We already know how the supper went off; and, of course, what
we want to know now is how the pilgrims could possibly get out of a
Giant's mouth, having once got into it. The first thing they did, on
being gobbled up, was to draw themselves out from Gargantua's great
teeth as well as they could, thinking all the time that
they had been cast into the deepest dungeon of some
frightful prison. That was bad enough; but when
Gargantua began to swallow his big drink, tossing the green lettuces
past his teeth and sending it rushing down his throat like a sour
deluge, they found themselves in a terrible fix and in danger of
drowning. It was then that the poor fellows began to hop for their
lives. Leaping nimbly, by aid of their staffs, they succeeded at last in
getting out of the throat, and finding refuge outside of Gargantua's teeth.
By ill luck, however, one of them, feeling here and there with his staff
to know whether the country around was quite safe, gave a sudden
plunge into the hollow of a bad tooth which had been troubling the
Giant for some time. At this, Gargantua began to roar with the pain
he felt. All he could think of in his agony was to call for his toothpick.
When he got it, he began to prod viciously into the bad tooth. At last
he grew tired, and putting his finger into his mouth, he hauled out one
of the pilgrims by the leg; another by the wallet; another by his
purse; another by the arm; and the poor man, who had caused all the
trouble, by his neck; and threw each on the ground as one might
a fish-bone.</p>

<p>As soon as they found themselves on the ground the pilgrims,
without stopping to explain how it happened that they had been found
in the lettuce-field, and feeling sure that Gargantua had not seen them,
scampered away as fast as their legs could carry them.</p>

<h4>HOW FRIAR JOHN COMES TO THE FEAST, AND HOW KING GRANDGOUSIER
<a id="HAD_RECRUITED_HIS_ARMY"></a>HAD RECRUITED HIS ARMY.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 198px;">
<img src="images/064.jpg" width="198" height="228" alt="Initial I" />
</div>

<p>It was, of course, at this same supper, of
which the three Very Fat Cooks were
so proud, that the old King, as soon as
ever the company were seated, started
to give the whole story of the wicked
war which Picrochole had made on him.
When he came to that part of his story,
in which he had to speak of the wonderful
things Friar John had done in the
Abbey vineyard, nothing would do but
that the brave monk should be invited
to the Palace to receive the thanks of
the whole joyous party.</p>

<p>Gargantua sent post-haste for Friar John.</p>

<p>In a little while&mdash;for the Abbey was not very far off&mdash;here came
the good Friar on King Grandgousier's own mule, with his famous staff
held firmly in his right hand. When he was once fairly in the dining-room,
a thousand caresses and another thousand compliments greeted
him.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Friar John! Thou comest in good time! Welcome,
brave cousin!" shouted Grandgousier.</p>

<p>"We have kept your seat for you, Friar John," roared both
Grandgousier and Gargantua in a sort of giant concert.</p>

<p>And so, at last, seated on the right hand of Grandgousier, the
Friar was prevailed on to tell, in his own way, the story of his great
fight for the Abbey. Nothing would do them but that everybody
should jump up to see and feel for himself the glorious staff, with
which so many valiant deeds had been done.</p>

<p>Then the staff was reverently placed <a id="in_a_corner_of_the_room"></a>in a corner of the room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/065.jpg" width="372" height="450" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">FRIAR JOHN ARRIVES.</div>
</div>

<p>After supper, there was a long consultation about what ought to be
done with Picrochole. As is always the way, one said one thing;
another unsaid it; one had a plan; some one else had something better.
It was finally resolved not to wait for another day, but to start the
very next midnight, which&mdash;it being now two o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;was
only ten hours off. While some young men were sent
out as spies to bring word what Picrochole was doing, the rest
began to arm themselves with breast-plate and back-plate and all
the iron and steel plates they could get hold of. There was a
little trouble about what Friar John was to wear. They wanted to
put their iron and steel stuff on him; but the brave monk wouldn't
agree to it. He rushed to the corner where his staff was, grasped
it with both hands, and waved it in the air, saying, "Don't trouble
yourselves about me, good friends. <i>This</i> is what I saved my Abbey
with! I know <i>it</i>, and it knows <i>me</i>; it is good enough for <i>me!</i> I
am heart and soul with you. All I ask for is a stout horse, and
you will find me with my staff by your side whenever you want me."</p>

<p>"Very well, Friar," Gargantua said, laughing. "Every conqueror
has the right to choose his weapons. <i>You</i> are a conqueror;
keep yours."</p>

<p>When all the clocks were striking midnight, Gargantua left the
Palace with Ponocrates, Friar John always carrying his staff, Gymnaste,
Eudemon the page, and twenty-five of the most adventurous
knights, all armed from head to foot, and mounted like great Saint
George himself, each with a stout archer behind him.</p>

<p>These were to be followed, the next morning, by the whole
army, which had been recruited in a fashion that would look very
strange to-day. Let me tell you how it all was!</p>

<p>Before Gargantua had come back from Paris, and while Picrochole
was still galloping with his wicked soldiers over rich fields, and
trampling down fruits and vines, and cursing and cutting and slashing
away, and killing just as the fancy took him, Father Grandgousier
had sent messages to his friends and neighbors living a hundred
miles around, telling them all about the war; how his son Gargantua,
in whom he
trusted, was
far away in
Paris, studying hard at
his Latin; and asking
them to help him just as much
as they could in money and men.
It was in this way that it was
made as clear as the bright sun shining in heaven
at noonday, how many friends the good old
Giant really had. Some might say all this was because he was a
Giant; but I think it was not so much that as because he had
always, through a long life, been kind and gentle to little men.</p>

<p>Taking what one Prince, and another, gave in money, Father
Grandgousier raised among his neighbors one hundred and thirty-four
million and two and a half crowns of pure gold.</p>

<p>When he read their lists, giving the number of soldiers each one
was able to lend him, he found that he would have:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">15,000 men at arms.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">32,000 cavalrymen.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">89,000 arquebusiers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">140,000 volunteers.</span><br />
</p>

<p>That is to say, 276,000 stout soldiers, all well equipped and provisioned
for six months and four days. To which were to be
added:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">11,200 cannon.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">47,000 double cannon, etc.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The good old Giant felt very grateful; but he swore, nevertheless,
a round oath that there was no need for him to accept
so great an army. Where was he to put two hundred and seventy-six
thousand soldiers? Where could he store away fifty-eight
thousand cannon? If he could only be sure that his Gargantua
would come home in time, why, he wouldn't care for any army at
all!</p>

<p>"If my boy Gargantua should once get among that Picrochole
gang, he would scatter them over the border quicker than they ever
crossed it," he was saying to himself all the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that rogue Picrochole was going on at such a rate
with his pastime of cursing, killing, cutting, and slashing at men, and
ravaging vineyards, and burning houses, that Grandgousier found that
he had really to do something that would strike terror. So he sent
another Royal Messenger to his friends the Princes, telling them
that he would be satisfied, for the present, with</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2,500 men-at-arms.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">66,000 infantry.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">26,000 arquebusiers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">22,000 pioneers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">6,000 light cavalry.</span><br />
</p>

<p>122,500 men, all to
be well equipped and provisioned
by his friends,
as promised. He added,
in a postscript, that all
else he needed would be
two hundred pieces of
<a id="heavy_artillery"></a>heavy artillery.</p>

<p>"Let them come at once," he said. "If

those wild Paris lads, they may be useful.
But if he once gets home, I wouldn't give
that"&mdash;snapping his fat old fingers&mdash;"for
the whole Picrochole gang!"</p>

</div>

<p>This was the army that followed Gargantua
at daybreak and came up with
him at the Ford of Vede. Gargantua
was commander-in-chief in place of
Grandgousier, who, being old, of course
stayed at home. But that was a glorious
early breakfast which the old King
gave to the soldiers before they left;
and he made it more glorious by promising
great gifts to every man who
would do some wonderful act of prowess.
"They will not have a chance to
do anything," he whispered confidentially
to his Chief Butler, whom he had raised to a level with his
mouth. "<i>My boy will be there!</i>"</p>

<p>The army crossed the Ford in boats and on bridges lightly made
over smaller boats, which dipped to the water's edge as the soldiers
passed over. After a short march they came upon the city, which was
placed upon a high hill. There they halted. Gargantua called a
council, and with his friends discussed all night what was best to be
done next morning. Gymnaste was the first to speak to the point.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said, "I am in favor of attacking at once. You will
do so if you know those French fellows as well as I do. They are
<i>terrible</i> foes at the first assault, when they are worse than so many
devils. But if they are kept idle, and dream too long of their sweethearts
and their vines, they lose heart, and become worse than so many
women."</p>

<p>Gargantua was nodding approval all the time Gymnaste was
speaking. He was quite sure, in his own mind, that, when once <i>he</i>
would show himself on his great Mare, and with his huge tree held as
a lance, Picrochole would lose the field. But he had no idea of putting
himself forward just then. So he said nothing more than: "So be it!
<a id="We_advance_at_daylight"></a>We advance at daylight."</p>

<div class="caption">MOUNTING FOR THE FRAY.</div>
</div>

<p>The advance-guard were stationed on the hill-side, while the main
army remained on the plain. Faithful Friar John took
with him six companies of infantry and two hundred
horsemen, and, with all speed, crossed
the marsh, and gained, on the
highway of London, a point just above the Castle. While the assault
was going on, Picrochole and his people didn't know at first which was
better: whether to march out from the Castle, resolved to conquer or
to die, or to stay in the city, and let the enemy outside do their worst.
At last Picrochole himself grew tired. He had done nothing during the
whole war but take care of his own precious body behind the walls of
the city, while his officers and soldiers slashed and killed the poor
subjects of Grandgousier at their will. He had not heard a whisper of
how Gargantua had come all the way from Paris, and was then actually
in front. He swore roundly, over his cups,
that Gargantua was not there, or he would have
heard of it long before. "Ha! ha! Giants are too
big to hide themselves. <a id="Victory_shall_be_ours_he_cried"></a>Victory shall be ours!" he
cried.</p>

<img src="images/070.jpg" width="154" height="600" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE ASSAULT.</div>
</div>

<p>This was what made Picrochole bold enough to
make an attack. Once beyond the gate, he and his
army were received with such a welcome of cannon-balls
that they were for a moment confused.
Picrochole looked around for the Gargantuists; he
couldn't see one of them, as Friar John had taken
his men back with him to the hills, so as to give
the artillery room to work. Encouraged by this,
Picrochole defended himself so bravely under the
terrible fires, and advanced so steadily all the time
on the guns, that the gunners were obliged to flee
for their lives, and Friar John himself found it hard
to keep him from charging over his small force.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! Friar John," he muttered to himself,
"thou thinkest thyself a fine soldier, truly! But
it is high time now to call the Giant." So he shouted
with the full strength of his sturdy lungs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Help! help! help! Prince Gargantua
to the rescue!"</p>

<p>One might live to be as old as Methuselah,
and never see such a change in either
a general or his army as that which took
place in King Picrochole and his troops when
they first heard the Friar's cry. The guns
dropped from their hands, and all they could
do was to turn with white faces and staring
eyes towards the opening in the wood.</p>

<p>Then appeared a fearful apparition!</p>

<p>It was that of the Giant, holding, poised
as a lance, the trunk of an enormous tree
stripped bare of its branches; his
eyeballs swollen and blazing with
anger; his legs drawn tight to the
saddle, while he gave free rein to
his Mare, and dashed with the
speed of a cyclone straight down
upon them. The Mare seemed as
mad as the master, for smoke rolled and curled around her wide-open
nostrils; she gave short and horrible neighs, as if she couldn't get to
Picrochole's rogues fast enough; her mane was stiff and hard, while
her broad tail, streaming like a comet behind her, whisked men right
and left, high into the air, and jerked down such trees as were in the
way as she swept thundering down the hill. So terrible a sight changed
the whole field. For a moment or two the enemy seemed stunned.
But, as the dreadful Mare came near and nearer, Picrochole's cowardice
broke the fearful spell that had come upon himself and men. "It
is the Giant!" he shouted; "save himself who can!" and dashed back
into the open gates of the city, intending to escape, through another
gate, into the country beyond. "<i>The Mare! the Mare! Save us from
the Mare!</i>" was all the poor men, as they tried to follow their king,
<a id="could_gasp"></a>could gasp.</p>

<p>Some were lucky enough to gain the city-gates. But before
Gargantua could rein in his powerful steed, she had bitten and trampled
many to death, to say nothing of those she had swept into the
air with her great tail. Gargantua had good reason to be pleased
with his victory. It was a decisive one, and gained by himself alone,
and the Mare. He rode all over the field, petting the good Mare
meanwhile, and never ceasing to look among the killed for Picrochole.
Of every officer that returned from pursuit of those who tried to
<a id="escape_he_asked"></a>escape he asked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>"Hast thou caught Picrochole?"</p>

<p>No, nobody had.</p>

<p>"With all my heart I am sorry," said Gargantua, "that Picrochole
is not here. For I would have made this little king know that it was
not for any riches or for my name that this war was made. As he is
lost, let the kingdom remain with his son. But, as this child is not
yet five years old, he should have governors. Let Ponocrates govern
<a id="those_governors"></a>those governors."</p>

<p>Then, under his breath, the Giant muttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho! a pretty king, this Picrochole, to be lost in battle." And
a giant's mutter is louder than a small man's shout.</p>

</div>

<p>When Gargantua, after the battle, made
his triumphant entrance into the city,
it was easy enough for him to find the
Palace where Picrochole had stopped,
but not quite so easy to get hold of the
King himself. And when he reached
the Palace, he heard that those wicked
advisers and councillors of Picrochole,
who had done their best to keep mischief
alive,&mdash;Swashbuckler, Durtaille,
and Smaltrash,&mdash;had all managed to
escape helter-skelter from the city, just
six hours <i>before</i> the battle.</p>

<p>Gargantua's first duty was to order a muster of his troops, by
which he learned, much to his satisfaction, that they had not suffered
greatly in the battle, the four soldiers who had been killed happening
to belong to the band of one of his officers, Captain Tolmere. He
had the pleasure of shaking his old master Ponocrates by the hand
on his lucky escape in having his doublet, instead of his portly body,
jagged by an archer's bolt. It was a mild shake, for a hearty one
would have made a jelly of it. The Chief Treasurer was ordered to
see that all his brave followers should be feasted, each with his troop,
at the Prince's expense. He directed, moreover, that, after the feast,
the army should assemble in the great Square before the Palace, and
receive a full six months' pay on the spot.</p>

<p>This being joyfully done, the next order was for the assembling
of all that remained of Picrochole's party. All his princes and captains
being present, Gargantua made a speech, which was as full of
wisdom as it was rich in praise of his good old father, King Grandgousier.
He concluded with these words, spoken in a stern voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I impose on those who have wickedly attacked us but one condition.
They must deliver into my hands that knave Marquet, who
was the groundwork of <a id="this_most_unjust_war"></a>this most unjust war."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
<img src="images/074.jpg" width="481" height="327" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">GARGANTUA'S CAPTIVES.</div>
</div>

<p>Marquet, who had been a great man all during the war, and who
had strutted around, crowing and looking wise, and had been consulted,
and patted on the back, and stroked on the head, ever since
his fight with Forgier, had been silly enough, instead of running away
as fast as his legs could take him, to go to the assembly to hear what
the Prince had to say. The moment Gargantua mentioned his name,
quiet, well-to-do neighbors, who had all along been vexed at the airs
he had put on,&mdash;being on every side of him,&mdash;pointed him out with
their fingers, slily, wickedly whispering, "You want Marquet,&mdash;there
he is, that man over there!" The wretch was at once seized by a
dozen strong and willing hands, and hauled and hustled about, till, at
last, he stood, breathing hard, before Gargantua. The Giant, towering
above him,&mdash;there was no chair in the Palace large enough for
him to sit comfortably in,&mdash;looked at him for a moment with scorn.</p>

<p>"So it is thou who art Marquet, art thou?"</p>

<p>"Yes, may it please Your Most Gracious, Most Merciful Highness,"
gasped Marquet, stuttering horribly, and turning very pale.</p>

<p>"Gymnaste," said Gargantua, "I make thee responsible for this
wretch, and his safe delivery to our Headsman for immediate execution."</p>

<p>Gymnaste, after bowing respectfully, collared Marquet and
marched him off.</p>

<p>After the rogue had been borne away to the block, Gargantua
ordered that all who had been killed should be honorably buried in
the Black Soil Valley. For the wounded, he made ample provision in
his Royal Hospital. To the survivors, he did no other hurt than to
put them to work on the printing-presses which he had lately set up.
When leaving, he graciously thanked his weather-beaten, if not war-beaten,
veterans, and sent them to winter-quarters with rich gifts for
each one; for, even though Picrochole had run away, there was no
telling but what the Bunmakers might make another fight, and so it
was thought wiser to keep the army together for a while. But to this
rule he made special exception of those of his legions who had had
the good luck, during the pursuit, of doing some gallant deed. There
were a good many of those brave soldiers who had marched, rank
upon rank, after the staff of the Giant himself, and had done some
brave action upon Picrochole's men, while their master's great Mare
was switching her terrible tail, and knocking men down with the right
whisk and the left, and driving from the field all who were lucky
enough to <a id="get_out_of_her_way"></a>get out of her way.</p>

<img src="images/075.jpg" width="418" height="500" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">REWARDING THE ARMY.</div>
</div>

<p>The Giant breathed a rumbling sigh of relief at getting through
so much hard work. "I start for home at daybreak," he said. "Let
my staff and these brave men, worthy of laurels, follow me."</p>

<p>The distance between Roche-Clermaud and the Palace of his
father was not so very great; so that, leaving at daybreak the next
day, Gargantua, with his staff and a long line of the brave officers
and soldiers who had
done such good service, following,
reached the Palace very leisurely by
sundown. It was a joyful day when
Father Grandgousier, who, since Gargantua
had left, seated so grandly on
his great Mare, had been all the time
praying for his safety, was told by
the sentinels at the gate that the
Prince, with a large retinue, was
coming near. The old man at once
hastened, in high glee, as fast as his
gouty feet could carry him, to the
court-yard, so as to be ready to receive
his son. The moment Gargantua rode in through the gateway,
Grandgousier shouted out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! ho! ho! So thou art there, my boy! Come quickly
to thy Father's arms!" Even while he was saying these words he was
whispering aside to Snapsauce, the Very Fattest of the three Very
Fat Cooks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get up, thou rogue, within two hours, the finest supper that has
ever gone down mortal throats since the days of my cousin King
Ahasuerus! My boy has come back a conqueror!"</p>

<p>Gargantua had already leaped down from his Mare and had rushed
towards his father. It was truly a meeting of Giants, which the little
men around could only manage to see by craning their necks in the
air. After embracing, Grandgousier and Gargantua passed up the
broad stone stairs which led to the main hall. They had not long to
wait upon the three Very Fat Cooks, who, by the way, had sent out
messengers miles and miles along the road by which their young
master was to come, and had known half a day before Father Grandgousier
himself did, the very hour when the Prince would reach the
Palace. Cunning Very Fat Cooks!&mdash;they had only to send up the
finest supper that had ever been seen since the days of King Ahasuerus,
which had been all ready to be served long before the King had even
thought of ordering it.</p>

<p>Everybody was in good humor, none more so than the jovial old
King himself. When the huge table was cleared of all its rich viands
and its sparkling wines, and the guests were about leaving the hall,
Grandgousier distributed to each of the deserving soldiers the ornaments
on the sideboard, which, in the mass, weighed eight hundred
thousand and fourteen golden besants worth in great antique vases,
rich pots, basins, superb cups, goblets, candlesticks, comfit-boxes, and
other such golden plate. In addition to this princely gift, Grandgousier
caused to be counted out from the Royal Coffers, to each hero,
twelve hundred thousand golden crowns; and, as a further mark of his
special favor, he directed that to such as he named should be granted,
in perpetuity for themselves and their heirs, if they should happen to
have any, certain castles and neighboring lands.</p>

<p>To Master Ponocrates, he gave Roche-Clermaud.</p>

<p>To Gymnaste, Le Coudray.</p>

<p>To Eudemon, Montpensier.</p>

<p>And so on with the favorites.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! my boy!" suddenly
cried Father Grandgousier, tapping
his big forehead with his
mighty finger. "We have
forgotten some one, and him
our bravest, too!"</p>

<p>"Whom?"</p>

<p>"Why, our gallant
Friar."</p>

<p>"Oh! as for Friar
John, trust him
to me, Father.
<i>I</i> shall take care
of him!"</p>

<p>"What wilt
thou do, my boy?"</p>

<p>"What will
I do? Why, I
shall build for
him a Monastery
a hundred
times more
magnificent
than those Convents
at Bonnivet,
Chambourg,
and
Chantilly, that
are the boast of
the world. Our
Friar shall be the
Abbot of Theleme
and he will make a
<a id="famous_Abbot_too"></a>famous Abbot, too!"</p>

<p>And so Gargantua built for his friend Friar John a Monastery
greater than the Convent at Bonnivet, and the Convent at Chambourg,
and the Convent at Chantilly; for his had nine thousand, three hundred
and thirty-two chambers. But its greatest beauty, after all, was
a wonderful winding stairway, up which six men-at-arms might ride
abreast, with their six lances at rest, to the very top of the Abbey.</p>

<p>After the war of the Bunmakers, all
the kings and princes and nobles, for
hundreds of miles around, came to
congratulate the two mighty Giants.
It was a time of royal feasting, and
the Palace smelt more strongly of old,
rich, dead dinners and suppers than
ever before. For a whole year, its
walls rang with laughter and joyous
shouts, and then the kings and princes,
nobles and friends, took to horse
and returned to their homes, leaving
Grandgousier and Gargantua in peace,
with the love of all their subjects and
the respect of their neighbors, for many happy years, over which
there was but one cloud, the death of the kind old Queen Gargamelle.
During all these years, more than I can now tell, Grandgousier was, of
course, getting old, and at last grew so weak that he was forced to take
to his bed.</p>

<p>"Gargantua, my boy, thou art already getting on in years," the
old man said one day, after a fit of weakness, when he felt that he could
not long live. "Why dost thou not marry, my son?"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, Father, I have never once thought of marrying.
Thou hast been so good to me that thou hast driven all thoughts
of women away from me. Yet, if thou sayest the word, then shall I
seek a wife."</p>

<p>"Seek, then, my boy, the Princess Badebec, the beautiful daughter
of my good friend, the King of the Amaurotes, in Utopia. Make her thy
wife if thou lovest thy Father. And thy Father's blessing will be on
thee forever!" The good old King had scarcely whispered the last
word when he feebly placed his hand on the head of Gargantua, who
was kneeling by the bed. Then he stretched out to his full giant-length,
gave a deep sigh of content, and died.</p>

<p>Gargantua was then at an age which would, in our day, be looked
upon as quite venerable. He was just five hundred and twenty-one
years old on the day when he buried his Father. He mourned him two
years to the very month, day, hour, and minute. At the end of the
last year, he charged his Prime Minister with a solemn proposal of marriage
to the charming Princess Badebec. None so lovely as the
Princess Badebec had, up to that time, ever been seen outside of
Utopia.</p>

<p>Gargantua was five hundred and twenty-three years old when his
nuptials with the Princess were celebrated in great state, and he had
just turned his five hundred and twenty-fifth year, when he had at once
the great joy of hearing that he had a son, and the deep sorrow of
losing his dear wife, the lovely Queen Badebec herself.</p>

<p>The babe first saw the light at a time when there was such a
drought over the whole land that there had been no rain for three
years, three weeks, four days, and thirteen hours. But to understand
clearly the reason why the little fellow was christened <span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span>,
it should be said that, during the awful drought, the sun glared down
so fiercely on the baked earth that all the country around became
barren. Never had there been felt such heat as then. There was not
to be found a tree on which a leaf or flower could be coaxed to grow;
the grass was sickly and yellow; the rivers seemed to vie the one with
the other in laying bare their sandy beds; the fountains ran dry; the
poor fish, with no water to keep them alive, floundered gasping in the
muddy sand, until they died; the birds, little and big, some giving the
shrillest of despairing shrieks, others the most plaintive of dying twitterings,
all dropped dead in mid-air for very want of dew; and wolves,
foxes, stags, wild boars, deer, hares, rabbits, weasels, and such other
beasts as were unfortunate enough to roam about the forests, were to
be found stiff in the fields, by the side of streams long dried up, and of
fountains which no longer ran, with their red and swollen throats and
<a id="mouths_gaping_wide_open"></a>mouths gaping wide open.</p>

<img src="images/078.jpg" width="474" height="256" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE DREADFUL DROUGHT.</div>
</div>

<p>But it was, after all, the poor men and women who were to be
most pitied during all this awful time. They were to be found everywhere,
with their tongues hanging out like those of hares which have
run before the hounds for hours. The hot glare of the sun, and the
horrible thirst, turned these poor people half-crazy. Some would
throw themselves into wells, hoping to find water in their dark depths.</p>

<p>Others would creep under the bellies of such cows as were still living,
declaring, with a sickly smile, they were going there to get into the
shade. Of course everybody flocked to the churches; people always
do in a time of great trouble. It was really pitiful to see the eager way
the worshippers rushed to the font where the holy water was kept.
But to think that in doing so they only wanted to dip their fingers reverently
into the blessed water, and to cross themselves piously, would
be far from the truth. What each worshipper went to the church for
was only to see if he couldn't scoop all the holy water in the font into
a pitcher he kept under his cloak, as a drink for himself and his family,
who had squeezed in as near after him as they could. It was a
fight every day between the priests and such selfish church-goers; but
the priests always got the better in the fight, as was right, since the
holy water was meant for the comfort of penitent sinners, who sought
the Church for humble worship, not for the use of thirsty sinners, who
only came there to quarrel and steal.</p>

<p>It was towards the close of this awful parching time, when the
people were most thirsty, and the deepest wells were empty, and
the brightest fountains had run dry, and all the birds of the air and all
the forest beasts were dead, and there was a general cry everywhere of
"We are dying of thirst! water! water!" that Gargantua's baby
<span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span> was born.</p>

<p>This was a very good name, for it was given on account of this
dry time. Gargantua had, while in Paris, studied only a little Greek,
while he had studied much Latin, under Master Ponocrates. He
chose, therefore, from the Greek language one-half of the name for his
son, viz.: <span class="smcap">Panta</span>, which is the Greek for <i>all</i>, and the other half <span class="smcap">Gruel</span>,
which is an Arabian word, meaning <i>thirsty</i>. Therefore, baby <span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span>
was only another name for baby <i>All-Thirsty</i>; and he well deserved
the name, since it was soon found that nobody could come near
the young Prince without feeling thirsty.</p>

<p>It matters not how Pantagruel got his name. He was the same
kind of baby that his father had been before him, and was pronounced
by all to be a marvellous young Giant, indeed. The Wise Women
took charge of him upon his birth, and after washing and dressing him,
while gravely wagging their old gray heads, with their skinny fingers
to their noses, muttered darkly, the one to the other:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our young Prince is born all hairy like a bear! He will do
wonderful things, and, if he lives, he will surely reach old age!"</p>

<p>Gargantua hardly knew whether he
ought to cry because his beloved Queen
Badebec was dead, or laugh because his
son Pantagruel was alive.</p>

<p>"My good wife is dead, who was
the most <i>this</i> and the most <i>that</i>, which
ever was in the world," he would blubber
at one time. "Ha! Badebec, my
wife, I shall never see thee again! Thou
hast left me, my pet, forever! Ah! my
poor Pantagruel, thou hast lost thy good
Mother, thy sweet nurse. <i>Holos!</i>"</p>

<p>The poor Giant burst into tears,
which flowed down his cheeks as large as ostrich-eggs, and he cried
like a cow. Then his humor would change, and he fell to laughing
like a calf.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! my little son, how pretty thou art, and how grateful
I should be to God that he has given me such a son. Ho! ho! ho!
how glad I am! Let us drink! Throw melancholy out of the window;
bring here the best wines; rinse the glasses; lay the cloth; drive
away the dogs; blow up that fire; light the candles; shut the door;
skim the soup; call in the beggars, and give them what they want!
I ought to be happy,&mdash;I <i>am</i> happy. Ho! ho! ho!"</p>

<p>Poor old Giant! He was very proud, but he was <a id="very_wretched_all_the_same"></a>very wretched
all the same.</p>

<div class="caption">THE FUNERAL OF QUEEN BADEBEC.</div>
</div>

<p>It would be a wonderful thing to tell how quickly Pantagruel grew
in body and in strength. All the old-world talk about "Hercules
in his cradle killing the two serpents" was nothing to boast of, because
<i>his</i> snakes happened to be both small and weak. But Pantagruel,
in his cradle, did things much more astonishing. Just think
of his needing, as a baby, at every meal, the milk of four thousand
six hundred cows! When it became necessary to order a kettle for
him in which to boil his milk it took all the braziers of Saumure, in
Anjou; of Villedieu, in Normandy;
of Bramart, in Lorraine, to make it.
They used to give him soup in a great
bell, which was long to be seen at
Bruges, in Berry, near the Palace, with a hole
in it. How did that hole ever get there? Why,
in the easiest way possible! Baby Pantagruel's teeth were already so
big, and sharp, and strong, that, in his eagerness to get at the broth,
he made a quick snap at the metal and broke through it, as though it
were as <a id="flimsy_as_an_egg-shell"></a>flimsy as an egg-shell.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="images/081.jpg" width="467" height="405" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL'S PORRINGER.</div>
</div>

<p>Another morning, at daybreak, when one of the four thousand
six hundred cows, which gave him his principal food, was brought in
to give him his breakfast, Pantagruel burst the bands which bound
his arms, and caught hold of that poor cow to eat her alive; and he
would have, without doubt, eaten her all up if she hadn't bellowed as
loudly as though a pack of wolves were just at that moment striking
their teeth in her legs. At the poor cow's cries, everybody ran up
and released her from the Giant baby's awful teeth. Such an offence
as trying to eat alive an innocent cow, which had done her best, among
her four thousand five hundred and ninety-nine companions, to give
him milk, could not pass unnoticed. Gargantua, although, away
down in his own heart, he was proud of his
little son's strength, grew very much afraid
that, in some of his antics, he might hurt
himself. He at once ordered Pantagruel to
be bound to the cradle with great cables, and
directed that, on no account, he should be
allowed to get free from them. Here, then,
was our poor Pantagruel in a bad fix! Baby
as he was, he often felt very wretched; but
never more wretched than when a great,
shaggy bear, which was a special pet of his
father, made it a point of politeness to drop in every day and, with his
dirty tongue, to lick his face, which, on the other hand, the Wise
Women made a point never to touch. That bear came once too often.
Pantagruel, being in a bad humor one particular day, and feeling the
rough, furred tongue licking all over and over his face, gave one tremendous
jerk, and broke his chains as easily as Samson had broken
those of the Philistines. Then he stretched out his hairy hands, and
caught Master Bear, and tore him into pieces with as much ease as he
might have done a chicken.</p>

<p>This new exploit made Gargantua still prouder of his son; but it
was high time that something should be done with him. So he ordered
to be made four great iron chains to hold him fast. One day a feast
was given by King Gargantua in honor of the princes and nobles of his
Court. It is pretty clear that all the great people, not to speak of the
servants, had their time so well taken with the feast, that nobody ever
thought it his business to bother himself about the little Prince, away
upstairs in the nursery. If Pantagruel hated any one thing above
another, that one thing was to be left by himself. What made it all
the worse this time was that there he was in his cradle, closely
chained, and obliged to listen to the gay sounds that swelled up,
every now and then, from the dining-room. The poor child felt
lonely. He tried to burst the chains which bound his arms to
his cradle; but that he couldn't do, because they had been forged
too strong and stout by the Royal Blacksmith. Then he began such
a stamping with his feet that he broke the foot-board of his cradle,
which was made of a great beam seven feet square. The moment he
had succeeded in getting his feet quite out of the broken end, he
slid forward as far as the chains would let him, until at last his
feet touched the floor. Then, with a great wrench, he raised himself
on his feet, bearing his cradle triumphantly on his back, which
made him look for all the world like a turtle, with his shell, trying
to climb a wall.</p>

<p>Such was the strange sight which, on presenting itself in the Banqueting
Hall, startled the gay company. Pantagruel walked straight to
the table, where he at first thought he would need no assistance; but
he soon found himself obliged&mdash;not being, of course, able to use his
hands&mdash;to lean forward, and lick up with his tongue any tidbit that
he could find near the edge of the table. When his father saw how
hungry he was, he knew well enough that his baby never would have
broken through his cradle, and tramped down the stairs with it on his
back, unless he had been left alone by his nurses. Turning to the
princes and lords present, he asked them if it was not better that his
boy should be freed from those heavy chains.</p>

<p>The guests, with one
voice, declared that
the chains were an
insult to the young
Prince; and even the
First Physician gave
it as his opinion that,
if Pantagruel were to
be kept any longer
fastened in such a
way to his cradle, he
would all his life be
<a id="a_cripple"></a>a cripple.</p>

<p>The moment he
was unchained Pantagruel
sat down at
the table, and was
made much of by
every guest. Such a
welcome soon made
him feel quite at
home, and he showed
it by breaking, with
one blow of his fist,
that ugly cradle into more than five hundred thousand pieces, vowing
to himself&mdash;he couldn't well say the words&mdash;that he would never
be found in it again&mdash;never! never! never!</p>

<p>Pantagruel grew, from day to day, in
health, and stature, and strength,
which, of course, gave great delight to
his father. Gargantua ordered to be
made for his son, while he was still
small, a cross-bow, with which he could
make himself merry in shooting at the
little birds, and which is kept to this
day, and is known as the great Cross-Bow
of Chantelle. It was not long
after this that Pantagruel was sent off
to school at Poitiers, under the charge
of his tutor Epistemon, where he
showed himself <a id="a_diligent_scholar"></a>a diligent scholar.</p>

<p>Just before they left, while his son was getting into the saddle,
good Father Gargantua had taken Epistemon on his arm for a few
words of private talk. All he said, in a solemn whisper, was: "Teach
my boy, first of all, Greek; secondly, Latin. My father cared for
nothing so much as Latin. If I knew Greek half so well as I know
my Latin, <a id="I_should_be_happy"></a>I should be happy."</p>

<div class="caption">THE GREAT RAISED STONE.</div>
</div>

<p>Having noticed that the students of Poitiers had often so much
time on their hands that they did not know how to get rid of it, and
being a good-hearted young Giant, Pantagruel thought he would take
pity on them and devise
some plan to help them.
So, one fine day, he tore
from a great ledge
of rocks, which
the people of the town called Passelourdin, a large stone, about twelve
fathoms square, and carried it in his strong arms with the greatest ease
to four pillars which then stood in the middle of a field, upon which, by
sheer force, he placed the stone. None of the young students had the
slightest idea why the Giant of whom they were so proud had robbed
big Passelourdin, but it was not long before they began to do precisely
what Pantagruel had thought they would do. Whenever they had
nothing else to think about&mdash;which, by the way, happened the greater
part of every day&mdash;they would fill up the time by climbing up to
the stone, bearing with them flagons of wine and hams and pies, upon
which they feasted with loud shouts of laughter, each one being
sure to wind up his first day's fun by cutting his name deep into the
surface of the stone. By and by, it began to be
talked about as the "Raised
Stone." And, for a long time,
no student was allowed to
graduate at the University of Poitiers
unless he had first solemnly sworn that
he had drunk in the magical Fountain of Croustelles,
had taken a walk to Passelourdin, and had
from there climbed to <a id="the_top_of_the_Raised_Stone"></a>the top of the "Raised Stone."</p>

<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL VISITS HIS ANCESTOR'S TOMB.</div>
</div>

<p>While the students were making merry over their
new game, Pantagruel was poring harder than ever
over dusty old tomes in the Library of the University. One day,
while he was reading the fine chronicles of his ancestors, he happened
to turn over the page which told him of the famous Giant Jeffrey of
Lusignan, nicknamed "Jeffrey of the Great Tooth," who was buried
at Maillezais, near by. What should Pantagruel do but choose a play-day
to pay his respects to the sepulchre of the old Giant! Taking
some friends along with him he soon reached Maillezais. All the way
to the tomb he had been thinking of nothing but
how he would do it honor; but,
when he got there, his eyes
seemed glued to a picture
of his big-toothed
ancestor, which was
hanging on the wall.
It wasn't a cheerful
portrait, I must say,
for it made old Jeffrey
of the Great Tooth
look like a man in an awful fury and with a horrible toothache,
half-drawing his great malchus out of its scabbard. The moment
Pantagruel saw this, he grew half afraid and half angry. Pointing
sternly to the picture, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He has not been painted in this way without cause. See how his
eyes glare, and how his great tooth seems to come out in pain. Why
should he draw his malchus? I suspect that, at his death, some wrong
was done to him which he looks to his kindred to avenge. I shall
look deeper into this matter, and do what <a id="I_shall_think_to_be_right"></a>I shall think to be right."</p>

<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL SETTLES AT ORLEANS.</div>
</div>

<p>After having done a good turn for his fellow-students at Poitiers,
Pantagruel resolved to visit the other Universities of France. He did
not like Bordeaux very much, so he soon went to Toulouse. Here he
learned to dance and to use the two-handed sword,&mdash;a special exercise
with the students of that University. But he decided he wouldn't
stay any longer at Toulouse after he had occasion to see how the
students had sometimes a little trick of their own of roasting their
regents alive, like so many red herrings. So he strode off to Montpellier,
where he met pleasant company, and began to think, one day,
that he ought to study Medicine, and the next, that the Law was,
after all, the only thing for him; but he soon grew tired of all this
and, journeying from university to university, at last settled himself
after a time at Orleans. Here he was made welcome with joyous
shouts and much respect; and, as the students were none too fond of
their books, Pantagruel took great pains to become a master at
tennis,&mdash;the favorite game of the city. After several years passed
at Orleans, he consulted with Epistemon about going to the great
University of Paris. It was a glorious day for him&mdash;and I dare
say the sober teacher himself, under all his wise look, was just as
pleased as his pupil&mdash;when the journey was at last decided on. But,
before leaving, the Giant was told that an enormous bell, belonging to
the City of Orleans, had been lying under the ground at Saint Aignan
for more than two hundred and fourteen years, as it was so big and
heavy that no engine&mdash;much less, men&mdash;could be found strong
enough to move it from its place. The fact is, the good people of
Orleans, having heard that the Giant was thinking of leaving them
for good, came before him, humbly praying him, before his departure,
to bring that great bell to the tower which had been waiting ever so
many years for it. Pantagruel, with his usual kindness, went to the
spot where the bell was, and lifted it as easily as if it had been a
hawk's bell. As he was quite sure of his own strength, Pantagruel
thought that, before carrying the bell to the belfry, he would take a
stroll about the city with it in his hands, making it ring in the streets
and by-ways. Of course everybody in Orleans&mdash;man, woman, boy,
girl; even the babies, who didn't know what they were smiling at, but
showed their little white teeth and dimpling cheeks all the same&mdash;were
all out, crowding the streets and jostling in the by-ways. But
here, while our Pantagruel was amusing
himself and while the ringing was sounding
through the city, there came a terrible
misfortune, of which nobody had the
slightest idea at the time. It was only
found out at night, when the simple people
wanted to drink in honor of the great
event, that all the good wine of Orleans
had of a sudden curdled and turned sour.
It was the awful strokes of that tremendous
bell in Pantagruel's hand, as he
tramped up and down the streets, which
had curdled the Orleans wine, and made
the honest people who drank it spit as
white as cotton, crying out: "We have
caught the Pantagruel, and our very
<a id="throats_are_salted"></a>throats are salted."</p>

<p>After this exploit Pantagruel, with
Epistemon, and his valet Carpalim, was
very glad to start for Paris. On entering
that city, all the people stretched their
heads out of the windows to see him pass;
peering down at his feet as he tramped
through the streets, and then, with their
mouths wide open, craning their necks to
see how high in the clouds his head might
be. They were just a little afraid, in
their curiosity, that their visitor might
take up their King's Palace and stalk away
with it, as his father Gargantua, whom
every old woman had seen and of whom
every child had heard, had carried away,
years and years before, the Bells of

Mare's neck.</p>

<p>While in Paris, Pantagruel&mdash;as was the fashion for young men
to do&mdash;went one day to see the world-famous Victor Library. There
he found books with high titles on the covers, and no sense between
them. One look at the shelves of the Victor Library was enough for
the Prince.</p>

<p>After a few months passed in Paris&mdash;studying and gaining great
stores of knowledge all the time,&mdash;Pantagruel, in reply to one who
asked him what he thought of the city, answered drily, that while
"<i>Paris was a very good place to live in, it was a very bad place to

<img src="images/089.jpg" width="195" height="231" alt="Initial O" />
</div>

<p>One day Pantagruel was strolling outside
the city-walls towards the Abbey
St. Antoine. While engaged in philosophical
talk with his own people, and
several students besides, he happened to
see, coming along the road, a young man
of fine height and handsome presence,
who looked so bloody and so woebegone,
and whose clothes hung around
him in such tatters and rags, that he
seemed to have barely escaped with his
life from a pack of mad dogs. As
soon as his eyes fell upon the man,
Pantagruel said to his attendants:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you see that man yonder, coming from Charanton Bridge?
By my faith, he is poor only in fortune. As far as I can judge by his
features, Nature has given that man a rich and noble lineage."</p>

<p>When the stranger had come up to them, Pantagruel said to him:
"My good friend, I beg you to stop a moment, and answer a few questions
which I am about to ask you. You will not repent it if you do so, as
I feel a strange desire to aid you in the distress in which I see you, for
you excite my pity. Before all, my friend, tell me who you are? Where
do you come from? What do you seek? And what is your name?"</p>

<p>The stranger then answered him:&mdash;</p>

<p>In German&mdash;</p>

<p>To which Pantagruel, not knowing a single word, replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My friend, I don't quite understand this gibberish. If you want
us to get at your meaning, speak to us in another language."</p>

<p>Then the stranger spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Arabic&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha! Do you know what he is saying, Master?" cried Pantagruel
to Epistemon.</p>

<p>Epistemon's answer was a shake of the head.</p>

<p>Then in Italian&mdash;</p>

<p>To which Master Epistemon only said: "As much of one as of
the other, and nothing of either."</p>

<p>Then the solitary wanderer spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>In English&mdash;</p>

<p>What he said in a very strange English was: "Lord, if you be so
vertuous of intelligence, as you be naturally releaved to the body, you
should have pity of me; for nature hath made us equal, but fortune
hath some exalted, and others deprived; nevertheless is vertue often
deprived, and the vertuous men despised; for before the last end none
is good."</p>

<p>"Ho! still less," cried poor Pantagruel.</p>

<p>Then the Basque&mdash;</p>

<p>Carpalim, Pantagruel's valet, thought he caught something familiar
here, but the stranger went on as if nothing had been said.</p>

<p>In a rattling unknown language&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you speak a Christian tongue, my friend, or do you make
your lingo as you go along?" asked Epistemon, who was beginning to
get rather tired.</p>

<p>Then in Dutch&mdash;</p>

<p>"Quite as bad as the others!" muttered Pantagruel under his
breath.</p>

<p>Then in Spanish&mdash;</p>

<p>"See here, my friend," retorted Pantagruel, who in his turn was
getting tired, "I have not the slightest doubt that you are master of
various languages. But all I ask is that you should tell us what
you want to say in some tongue which we can understand."</p>

<p>Then in Danish&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think," said Eusthenes, "the old Goths must have spoken
that way."</p>

<p>Then in a sonorous tongue&mdash;</p>

<p>Here Master Epistemon thought it right to say: "This time I
have caught his meaning. What he has just said is in the old Hebrew,
rhetorically pronounced."</p>

<p>Then in Greek&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! That's Greek. I know it. How long didst thou stay in
Greece?" asked the valet Carpalim, who had once been in that
country.</p>

<p>The the low Breton tongue&mdash;</p>

<p>It was now Pantagruel's turn to
say: "It
seems to me
that I understand
what you are trying to say; for it is the tongue of my own
country, of <a id="Utopia_or_something_very_like_it"></a>Utopia, or something very like it."</p>

<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL MEETS PANURGE.</div>
</div>

<p>But, just as he was beginning to say something more, the stranger
broke out again:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Latin language&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's all very well, my friend, but <i>can't you speak French?</i>"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and very well, too, an it please you, my lord," answered
the man. "By good luck, the French is at once my natural
and maternal language. I was born in the garden of France,&mdash;fair
Toulouse."</p>

<p>"Then you are a Frenchman! Let us know at once what is your
name. If you satisfy me in this, you need never wander from my
company, and we shall be one to the other, as Æneas and Achates."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the stranger, "my name in baptism was Panurge. I have
just come home from Turkey, where I had the misfortune of being
made a prisoner in the expedition against Metelin. I have ever so
many good stories to tell Your Highness, more marvellous than those of
Ulysses. As you are gracious enough to promise to keep me among
your friends, I protest that I shall never leave you. I beg your pardon,
my lord, I want one word more. I am desperately hungry, my teeth
being very sharp, and my throat very dry. A dinner just now would
be just as good as a balsam for sore eyes."</p>

<p>Pantagruel, on hearing these words from the stranger, was
delighted. He at once ordered that a full meal should be got ready.
This being set before him Panurge, who hadn't eaten for two whole
days, stuffed himself and went to bed with the roosters, and never
woke up until dinner-time next day, when he leaped from his bed, and,
without so much as washing his face, reached the dining-room in three
hops and one jump.</p>

</div>

<p>While Pantagruel was at Paris, he was
receiving, every now and then, letters
from his father, which were so kind, and
so full of good advice to him to improve
himself in the Languages, that he had
not the heart to neglect them, even had
he wished. One day, after laughing
more than usual at one of Panurge's
pranks,&mdash;and his new friend had turned
out a queer fish indeed,&mdash;he thought it
was right to see how much he had really
learned. The very next day, therefore,
at all the crossings of the city he posted,
with his own hand, nine thousand seven hundred and sixty-four propositions,
challenging all the wise men of Paris to argue with him, and
show where, and in what, and how far, any of his propositions was
wrong. At so bold a defiance, the wise men of Paris puckered their
foreheads, opened wide their nostrils, breathed heavily, and ended by
accepting the challenge. They thought that a Giant's strongest point
was his body; but Pantagruel very soon proved to them that he was
stronger than all of them, bunched together, in brains.</p>

<p>It was at the gates of Sorbonne itself&mdash;the great University&mdash;that
Pantagruel, flushed with victory, next knocked. Sorbonne was
not too proud to meet the bold Giant from Utopia in a fair combat,
not of blows, but of words. For six weeks, Pantagruel maintained
his theses against all the theologians, from four o'clock in the morning
until six o'clock in the evening, with the exception of two hours
allowed for refreshment. The contest made a great noise in the
court, and most of the lords, masters of requests, presidents, counsellors,
bankers, secretaries, lawyers, together with the doctors and
professors of the great city, came to hear the learned talk day after
day. Among all these there were, of course, some very headstrong
and restive, who must needs take a hand in helping the theologians to
puzzle Pantagruel; but, at the end, they themselves were routed, the
most learned doctors of the <a id="Sorbonne_along_with_all_the_rest"></a>Sorbonne along with all the rest.</p>

<div class="caption">AT THE GATES OF SORBONNE.</div>
</div>

<p>From that time, everybody began to talk about Pantagruel's wonderful
knowledge,&mdash;as, before that, all the talk had been about his
monstrous size,&mdash;even to the wash-women, roast-meat sellers, pen-knife-makers,
and others, who, whenever they would catch a sight of
him on the street, would poke each other in the ribs and call out:
"<i>Oh, look, there he goes!</i>" Pantagruel would have been blind if he
had not seen these good people nudge one another, and deaf if he
had not heard what they were saying. He certainly was very much
pleased; but that is not at all strange, since Demosthenes, the prince
of Greek orators, felt the same when once, in passing along a street
in Athens, an old hag pointed her skinny fingers sharp at him, screaming:
"<i>That's the man!</i>"</p>

<p>So great did Pantagruel's fame become in Paris that, whenever
there was a law-nut harder to crack than usual, the parties would
appeal to him to decide between them, and his decisions were always
so just that, strange to say, both sides would go away satisfied,&mdash;which
is a thing hard to be believed, since the like is not to be seen
for thirteen Jubilees. His reputation also went abroad, and, in consequence,
attracted the attention of a wise Englishman named Thaumastes,
who came all the way from England with the sole intention
of seeing Pantagruel, and testing for himself if his knowledge was
so great as had been told. On reaching Paris, Thaumastes asked
where Pantagruel lodged, and, on being informed, went to the St.
Denis Hotel, where he found him walking in the garden with Panurge
on his arm. When his eyes first fell on the Giant, he was almost out
of his senses for fear, seeing him so big and so tall. At last he managed
to pluck up courage enough to salute him very courteously.</p>

<p>"Very true it is, mighty Sir," he said, "what Plato, prince of
philosophers, once declared, that, if the image of Science were corporeal
enough to be brought in all her beauty before the eyes of men,
she would excite in all the world great wonder. I came disposed to
wonder; now, seeing, I do more&mdash;I
admire. Having heard
of your renown I have
left country, home,
and kinsmen, and have, in spite of the long journey
and the hardships of crossing the sea, presented myself here with
the sole purpose of seeing you, and consulting you upon some passages
of Philosophy in which I believe, and yet cannot be sure, that
I am right. If you will only deign to solve my doubts, I hereby
declare myself your slave. But I beg to make plain one point, and
that is, that I wish to dispute through signs only, without speaking.
I shall be found, if it suits Your Magnificence, in the great hall of
Navarre, at <a id="seven_oclock_to-morrow_morning"></a>seven o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>

<div class="caption">THAUMASTES VISITS PANTAGRUEL.</div>
</div>

<p>Pantagruel, although by no means sure that he knew how to argue
with his fingers, replied with his usual grace to the courteous Englishman,
paying him many compliments for his design of carrying on a
great disputation by signs only. After which, Thaumastes,
who, by the way, had not quite got over his
fear of the Giant, went straight to the Cluny Hotel, where he lodged,
declaring when he reached there that he had never felt so thirsty in
all his life. He swore to the landlord that he thought that terrible
Pantagruel was even then clutching him by his throat&mdash;so
very dry and ready to choke he was.</p>

<p>On his side, too, Pantagruel was grievously disturbed. He did
nothing in the first part of his sleep, that night, but dream about books
with hard Latin titles, and visions of phantom hands hovering in the air
around his head, and making passes under his very nose. All he could
do was to turn and twist, and twist and turn again, in his bed, and
groan, so dolefully, that Panurge, rudely wakened from his first nap,
ventured to come into the room.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said, as he approached the bed, "don't trouble
yourself about this matter. Turn on your right side like a good Christian,
and go to sleep. With your permission, I shall answer Mr.
Englishman to-morrow. By my faith! I never yet saw an Englishman
who knew what to do with his fingers!"</p>

<p>Pantagruel was, of course, delighted to hear this. He knew how
sharp Panurge was, and how far he could go beyond other men. But
somehow he still had his misgivings; and so he turned his big body
around for the last time and went to sleep, only to be haunted all night
long by Latin books with hard names, and a plague of mocking fingers
<a id="making_signs_under_his_nose"></a>making signs under his nose.</p>

<p>The next morning, the great College of Navarre was packed with
people to hear the famous dispute between the Giant and the Englishman.</p>

<p>As soon as Pantagruel and Panurge reached the hall, all the professors
and students began, as was their custom, to clap with their
hands. But Pantagruel shouted out at the top of his voice, which
sounded as if a double cannon had been of a sudden shot off: "Peace,
all! If you trouble me here, I shall cut off the heads of every one of
you." At this terrible threat, the crowd stood amazed, and did not dare
even cough. The fact is, they grew so thirsty, all of a sudden, that
their tongues dropped out from their throats as if Pantagruel, instead
of stepping on the platform, had gone from one to the other salting
them all.</p>

<p>When everything was quiet, Panurge stepped forward with a
pleasant smile, and addressed the Englishman in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am only an insignificant pupil of my royal master, Prince
Pantagruel, whose reputation, here and elsewhere, is so noble and so
exalted; but I swear that I shall convince thee that, in all signs made
in the sacred name of Science, I am thy master, and can give thee all
the lessons thou mayst need."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" cried Thaumastes; "then, let us begin!"</p>

<p>It was a battle of signs, as we know already, not of words. The
<a id="Englishman_made_the_first_sign"></a>Englishman made the first sign.</p>

<div class="caption">THE DISPUTATION.</div>
</div>

<p>Some people thought at the time that Panurge, in his answer,
showed rather too plainly the low opinion he had of his learned antagonist's
skill in finger-moving. He suddenly raised his right hand in air,
then put the thumb inside of his right nostril while keeping the four
fingers stretched out, but close together in a line parallel with the tip of
his nose&mdash;meanwhile closing the left eye completely, and depressing
the right eye. Then he raised on high his left hand, with close pressing
and extension of the four fingers and elevation of the thumb, holding
his left hand in a straight line with his right, with about a cubit and a
half between them.</p>

<p>The Englishman answered, without seeming to understand this sign
of Panurge.</p>

<p>Then Panurge replied.</p>

<p>Then the Englishman.</p>

<p>Then both made, one after the
other, and with the greatest rapidity,
the neatest, the most skilful, the most
beautiful, the most dazzling, the
most speaking, so to say, signs, all in
the name of Science, but all so much in favor of Panurge, with the
little talking devil there is in French fingers, that Thaumastes became
so confounded that he began to blow like a goose, and finally gave
up the fight. But the Englishman, when he had been beaten, was
honest enough to say so. Rising from his seat, while gallantly taking
off his cap, he thanked Panurge in a low tone. Then, with a
loud voice, he addressed the learned assembly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lords, at this time, I can surely say that you have an incomparable
treasure in your presence. I refer to my Lord Pantagruel,
whose fame alone brought me here from the other end of England.
But you can better judge how learned the master must be since I find
so much skill in his pupil, for I have always heard that the scholar is
never above the master."</p>

<p>It is said that the Englishman, after his defeat, was well and honorably
treated by Pantagruel. It was also whispered that Thaumastes,
on his return to England, caused to be printed in London a book which
contained all the signs and the meanings of the Great Disputation, but
of which, strange to say, no copy has reached this day.</p>

<p>The new friend and attendant of Pantagruel
was, as has already been seen, a
man of good presence, neither too tall
nor too short. His nose was a fine
aquiline, so fine and sharp, indeed, that
its curve was said by even his best
friends to look for all the world like
the blade of a razor. He was thirty-five
years old, or thereabout, and was
the gayest, maddest, most reckless
roisterer that gay, mad, reckless, roistering
Paris had ever welcomed within
her walls. His purse never knew what
it was to be full. For, although he had, as he was fond of boasting, as
many as sixty-three different ways of getting money, he always had
two hundred and fourteen different ways of spending it. The fact is,
Panurge had as many cunning ways as a monkey, and could have
taught the wisest and grayest old monkey in the forest tricks of which
he, in his simplicity, had never once dreamed. He made it a point
never to go abroad without having a flask of good wine and a fat, juicy
slice of bacon hidden away under his gown, saying, "These are my
body-guard. I have no other sword." But if he had one special weakness,
it was the bitter hatred he bore against the sergeants and the
city-watch of Paris. Of course, these little eccentricities all came out in
time, and so became gradually known to Pantagruel, who often frowned
on them, but could not, for the life of him, each time he heard of a
new prank, help shaking the houses within a mile around, with the
<a id="rumble_of_his_hearty_laughter"></a>rumble of his hearty laughter.</p>

<div class="caption">PANURGE GETS MONEY.</div>
</div>

<p>It was one favorite custom of Panurge to gather three or four
good fellows, and make them drink like Templars toward nightfall,
when he would lead them to the high ground just above the church
St. Genevieve, or near the college of Navarre, about the hour the city-watch
were taking their rounds on the low ground below. He could
always make sure of the hour of the guard by laying a sword down
on the pavement, with his ear very close to it; and when he would
hear the sword hum, he knew that the watch were coming. As soon
as he had made sure of that, he and his companion would begin to
push one of the dirt-carts, always about there, with all their strength,
into the hollow, where it would come tumbling down on the unhappy
watch, who, by that time, had just reached the spot, setting them to
rolling and knocking about in the dust like so many swine. Of
course, the party would then scamper off in a hurry, as Panurge&mdash;who,
besides having a mortal dread of blows, was a born coward&mdash;had,
after two days, learned to know every street, crossing, lane, and
<a id="alley_in_Paris"></a>alley in Paris.</p>

<div class="caption">PANURGE AND THE DIRT-CARTS.</div>
</div>

<p>Another time he would drop
along some good, level place where
the watch were obliged to
pass, a long train of powder, and,
then, after finding a safe hiding-place,
when they had come, he
would fire the train at his end, laugh
a loud laugh while he watched their antics
in scurrying away, thinking all the time that
good St. Anthony was tugging away at their legs.</p>

<p>Now, Panurge was a very wise man, but, in
spite of all his learning, he dearly loved to plague
those whom he ought certainly to have most respected,&mdash;I
mean the Masters of Arts and the students of
the Universities. Whenever he would meet one of
these on the street, he was sure to do him some mischief, such as
pinning to his back little fox-tails, hare's ears, or <a id="some_such_roguery"></a>some such roguery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 243px;">

<div class="caption">PANURGE'S FUN.</div>
</div>

<p>Another great delight of Panurge was keeping a whip under his
gown, with which he used to lash, until his very arm ached, such pages
as he found carrying wine to their masters. He used to say it was to
make them go faster, and he was sure their masters would thank
him for it.</p>

<p>Another was to carry in his coat more than twenty-and-six little
fobs and pockets, which were always full,&mdash;one of a little lead-water;
another of a little blade sharpened like a glover's needle, with which,
I am ashamed to say, Panurge used to cut purses; another of some
bitter stuff, which he used to throw in the eyes of everybody he met;
and still others of a mixture which he would throw upon the dresses
and bonnets of good people, walking peaceably and soberly in the
streets.</p>

<p>Another trick was slily to fasten people together by little hooks,
which he always kept in his pocket, and to laugh till he grew black
in the face, on seeing how, in trying to get loose, they only tore their
clothes to rags.</p>

<p>Another was to provide himself with two or three looking-glasses,
and, by shifting them here and there in his hand from a distance,
throw the fierce light straight into the eyes of men and women,
who would get half-crazy trying to find out where their sudden
blindness came from.</p>

<p>Still another trick&mdash;and this was a very mean one&mdash;he used to
play with a small vial filled with the oldest and most rancid oil he
could find. Whenever he met a woman dressed as fine as a peacock,
he would come up, saying: "Why, here's a fine cloth, or a fine satin,
or a fine taffety," as the case might be. "Madam, may Heaven grant
you whatever your noble heart might wish for! You have there a new
dress. Heaven keep it long for you, fair dame!" While the rogue
was saying all these fine words, he would, of course, be placing his
hand on the collar or the shoulder of the lady, and smearing it all
over with his vile oil, and leaving a spot which could never be
scrubbed out. Then he would make his prettiest bow, and smile his
sweetest smile, saying: "My dear Madam, let me beg you to be very
careful about here, because there is a large and muddy hole just
before you, and you might soil
your beautiful dress."</p>

<p>At another time he would
carry a box filled with a well-powdered
sneezing-gum, into
which he would put a handsome
broidered handkerchief that he
had stolen on the way from a
pretty seamstress of the Palace.
He would go looking about for
some fine ladies, and whenever
he would meet them, with a great
show of reverence, he would take
out his scented handkerchief,
and, on pretence of showing its beauty, flirt it quickly before their
noses, at which the fine ladies would sneeze for four hours without
stopping.</p>

<p>Then Panurge would make a lower and more respectful bow than
ever, and go away to the nearest corner to have a quiet laugh by
himself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 194px;">
<img src="images/100.jpg" width="194" height="231" alt="Initial A" />
</div>

<p>A short time after the famous dispute,
Pantagruel heard two very startling bits
of news. One was that his father Gargantua
had been transported to the
country of the Fairies by Morgan, in
the same way that she had already carried
off Ogier the Dane and King Arthur.
The other was that, on hearing of this,
and taking advantage of it, the Dipsodes,
or Thirsty people, Gargantua's neighbors,
had swarmed from their fortresses
and ravaged a large part of Utopia, and
were even then besieging the chief city
of the Amaurotes. When Pantagruel heard this bad news he boiled
with rage. He left Paris without a word of good-by to anybody,
for the affair called for speed. He was accompanied only by his special
train, which included his master Epistemon, Panurge, Eusthenes, and
Carpalim. From Paris he went to Rouen. While on the road, Pantagruel
noticed that the French leagues were very short when compared
with those of other countries, which he had seen in his travels. He
asked Panurge how this could be. Then Panurge, who was never at
fault, after turning up his long nose, told him <a id="this_little_story"></a>this little story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/101.jpg" width="373" height="500" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL MARCHES TO ROUEN.</div>
</div>

<p>"In the old days, when that fine King Pharamond reigned over
France, there were no leagues, no metes, no furlongs, no recognized
boundaries between different countries; nothing, in fact, to show
where one country began and where another ended. That just old
King resolved to make all this right. So he caused to be brought
together in Paris two hundred of the brightest and prettiest girls and
boys to be found in all
France, whom he feasted
well for eight days. After
it the King called the two hundred children
before him, and gave them a sum of money large
enough for their expenses during a long journey.
He then commanded that they should not go
out by the same gate, but start away on different
roads, here and there, as their fancy
took them out from the city. He further
told them that, wherever they should stop
to play and run about in the bright sunshine,
and gather flowers, or chase the beautiful
butterflies, they should leave a stone there
to show that they had done so.</p>

<p>"That stone would mean, '<i>This is
one league</i>.'</p>

<p>"It was summer time in
the pleasant, flowery, laughing
month of June, when the
skies seem more full of blue,
the fields more full of green,
and the roses more full of
red, than they are at any
other time, that the gentle King Pharamond had gathered these innocent
children together. The whole party, with bright cheeks and
merry laughter, started from Paris by one road and another. How
could the children help feeling happy when the skies were so blue,
the fields so green, and the roses so red, and when the butterflies
would fly so near the ground, as if only too glad to be run after and
caught! And then each boy and girl knew that their generous King
had given them so much money that, to their simple fancies, it seemed
as if they could never spend it all, try as hard as they might.</p>

<p>"In those bright June days, full of light, and green, and blue,
they were always crying out: 'Let us stop! Oh, let us stop to play.'</p>

<p>"So they used, at first, to stop at every turn of the road to skip
and gambol about in the fields, to gather the pretty flowers, to chase
the brilliant butterflies, to sing back to the singing-birds in the trees,
and to breathe in the sweet summer air, after which, with ringing
laughter and the merriest shouts, they would leave a big stone to
mark the spot where they had been so happy.</p>

<p>"This explains, my lord," said Panurge, making a face, "why
<i>our leagues in France are so short.</i>"</p>

<p>"I see, I see," said the good Pantagruel, who had fallen into deep
thought.</p>

<p>"But the longest summer must come to an end," Panurge went on
to say. "And when children stop at every turn of the road to play in
the sun, and to run in the fields, and to pluck the flowers, and chase
the butterflies, and sing with the singing-birds, they are only robbing
themselves of their own glad time. For Autumn, with his clouds
that hide the sun, and his ugly days, and his chilly nights, must be very
patient if he does not soon begin to think it high time for him to come
on the scene. So it got to be quite another thing for the poor children
the farther they went from Paris, because they soon found out that
King Pharamond's gift, large as it was, could not last forever. The
more they travelled, the worse the weather, the nearer they came to
the bottom of their purse, the heavier grew the road, and the more
tired their little bodies became. At last, all that the weary children
prayed for was that they might reach the end of their hard journey
as fast as possible. But Autumn himself was getting very old by
that time, and fierce Winter, with his chilling breath, and his hands
of ice, and his mantle of snow, was beginning to wonder when brother
Autumn was going to give him a chance of dropping his shining mantle
over field, lane, and road. There were no longer any blue sky; no
longer any green fields; no longer any red roses for the children; and
the bright butterflies were all dead now, and the singing-birds were
all mute.</p>

<p>"All that the poor little children could now do, wringing their
hands, was to cry: 'Let us go on! Oh, do let us go on!'</p>

<p>"So, too sad to think of play, but remembering always the command
of their good King, they walked, or rather limped, along the
highway, and would rest as little as they could until they had reached
Germany, and gone to the very end of that country, to make sure that
they had done their duty."</p>

<p>After telling this legend of King Pharamond and his two hundred
little children, Panurge remarked, with a very ugly grin:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And this, Your Highness, is why <i>those cursed German leagues
are so long.</i>"</p>

<div class="caption">THE VOYAGE BEGINS.</div>
</div>

<p>Once more on blue water, keeping;
close to the Senegal coast of Africa,
they skirted by Cape Blanco and Cape
Verde, and, still steering south-east,
sailed on, day after day, until, after weathering the Cape of Good Hope,
they touched at the friendly kingdom of Melinda. Taking to ship
again after resting a week in Melinda, they made good progress with a
wind from over the mountains, and, after passing by Meden, Uti, Uden,
Galasin, by the Isles of the Fairies, and skirting the kingdom of
Anchoria, finally cast anchor in the port of Utopia, which is a little
over three leagues from the chief city of the Amaurotes, that was then
being hotly besieged by the <i>Dipsodes</i>, who, as you know, called themselves
the Thirsty People.</p>

<p>When they had rested a bit and got their land-legs well on again,
Pantagruel, who, even in sea-sickness,&mdash;and he had, in fact, been very
sick,&mdash;had been thinking of the perils in which his father's kingdom
had been placed, remarked: "My children, it is lucky that those rascals
have not occupied this port, and it is just as strange as lucky, because
the city is not more than three leagues off. But, before we march to its
relief, it would be wise to consider what is best to be done. Are you
all resolved to live or die with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Highness, yes!" responded all. "Count on us as
you might count on your fingers."</p>

<p>"I have somehow a trouble on my mind," Pantagruel went on to
say. "I know neither in what order nor in what number are my
enemies who besiege the city. If I could once know this, we should
more surely be able to help my poor people."</p>

<p>Then all the four companions cried out together: "Leave that to
us! This day shall not pass before we bring Your Highness news."</p>

<p>Panurge, as was to be expected, was the first to step forward.</p>

<p>"I undertake, my lord," he said, "to enter into their camp in
spite of their guards. What is more, I shall dine with them at their
own expense,&mdash;not one of them knowing who I am; visit their artillery;
count the number of tents of their captains; and strut at my
will through the bands without ever being once detected. For <i>I</i> am
of the lineage of Zopyrus."</p>

<p>Then Master Epistemon came forward:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know all the stratagems of the ancient captains and champions
of Antiquity; and all the ruses and artifices of the camps. Your
Highness need have no fear of my being caught, as I shall make them
believe of you what I please. For <i>I</i> am of the lineage of Sinon."</p>

<p>Then Eusthenes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall get through their trenches under the noses of their sentinels;
for I shall pass through them, and&mdash;in spite of them, even
though each one were as strong as a bull&mdash;break their legs and
wrench their arms for them as I pass. For <i>I</i> am of the lineage of
Hercules."</p>

<p>Then Carpalim:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As for me, Your Royal Highness, I promise to slip into the camp
if ever a bird can fly there, because my body is so light that I can
jump their trenches and leap through their tents before their keenest
eyes can see me. I am afraid of neither arrows nor bow-shots. As
for their swift horses, I laugh at them. I undertake to skim over
an ear of corn or the tall meadow grass, without either ever bending
under me. For <i>I</i> am of the lineage of Camilla, the Amazon."</p>

<p>Carpalim had scarcely declared that he was of the lineage of Camilla,
the Amazon, when a great shout was heard; and the whole
party, turning round to find whence the noise came, saw six hundred
light cavalry riding at full speed to see what ship had come into
port, and to capture the crew if fast riding and loud shouting could
do it.</p>

<p>Pantagruel's big nostrils opened and shut, and went up and down
in excitement, as he roared out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lads, get you at once to the ship! You see our enemies
there? I shall kill them, if they were ten times their number, just
as easily as though they were so many beasts. So get in there, and
you will have some sport!"</p>

<p>But Panurge, who, if a coward, was very sly, had been hatching
a plan of his own, and answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, my lord, there is no need of your taking so much trouble.
On the contrary, you are the one to go into the ship, both you and the
others, for I, myself, undertake, singly and without aid, to settle
those rogues. But there is no time for delay. Seconds are worth
hours now!"</p>

<p>The others joined in with Panurge.</p>

<p>"Well said, my lord. Let Your
Highness retire, and we shall help Panurge
in such a way that you will soon
learn what we can do when we try."</p>

<p>Pantagruel, who saw that trick, not
fight, was to win the battle, was highly
amused at all this. As
he started to go back
into the ship, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am willing, but on one condition.
If those rascals are too strong for you, <a id="call_out_for_me"></a>call
out for me."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">

<div class="caption">PANURGE DISCOMFITS THE HORSEMEN.</div>
</div>

<p>The first thing Panurge did was to get
two stout ropes from the vessel. After tying these to the capstan on
the deck he pulled them to the shore, where he twined them round and
round into two circles, one very large, and the other a smaller circle
inside of the larger one. After he had his two circles ready, he said
to Epistemon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go into the ship and wait until I call out. Then you will turn
the capstan as strong and as quickly as you can, drawing up, of course,
both these ropes as you turn."</p>

<p>Panurge had also a word of warning for Eusthenes and Carpalim:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait here, my lads, until the enemy come near, then make signs
that you surrender. But take care not to get your legs inside of these
ropes. All you will have to do is, while appearing to yield yourselves,
to get as far away from those fellows as you can."</p>

<p>Then Panurge, all in a hurry, rushed into the vessel once more,
and caught up a bundle of straw and a small barrel of gunpowder, the
contents of which he scattered along inside and outside of the two circles
of ropes. Holding in his hand a bit of lighted paper, and putting
on his most innocent face, he was ready for the men on horseback, who
just then came thundering down. The first rank came nearly as far as
the ship, but, because the sand was yielding, forty-four men and as
many horses were brought tumbling to the ground. Seeing the first
line fall, and believing that their comrades had met some resistance, the
others were about to rush to the rescue; but just here was heard the
mild voice of Panurge:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you will pardon me, if I say it is not we who have
stretched your noble companions there, but the sea-water, which makes
the sand slippery. We surrender at your good pleasure."</p>

<p>Eusthenes, and Carpalim, and Epistemon, who was on deck, said
the same thing.</p>

<p>But, even while he was talking, the cunning Panurge had been
sliding off and, when he saw that all the horsemen were drawn well
within the circles, and that his two friends had got to a safe distance,
making way for the cavalry who were pressing forward to see the ship,
shouted out suddenly to Epistemon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Turn! turn!"</p>

<p>Hearing these words, Epistemon began to turn for his life, and the
two ropes twisted themselves around the legs of the horses in such a
fashion that, in falling, they brought their riders down with them.
Those in the rear, seeing the trick, drew their swords to cut the ropes,
and so escape; but Panurge was quite ready for them. It was when
they did so that he fired his powder-train, which burned up every one
of the company, men and horses, except one. He only escaped the
flames because he was mounted on a Turkish horse of great swiftness,
which bore him off with his light hoofs. But when Carpalim saw this
he said to himself: "Here, now, is a chance to show that <i>I</i> am of the
lineage of Camilla!" and ran after him with such speed that he caught
up with the Turkish steed within less than a hundred steps, and, leaping
on his croup, hugged the rider from behind and brought him a prisoner
to the ship.</p>

<p>Pantagruel was, of course, in a most jovial mood, and praised to
the skies the cunning of his friends. Nothing would do but that they
should celebrate their victory in eating and drinking, and the prisoner
along with them. It was a merry feast on the shore, for all but the poor
captive, who was not at all sure that Pantagruel was not going to gobble
him up whole, which he might have done&mdash;his throat being so large&mdash;with
as much ease as he would have taken down a sugar-plum. Indeed,
the prisoner would not have made any greater show in the Giant's throat
than a grain of millet in an ass' mouth.</p>

<p>While they were thus chatting and feasting,
Carpalim suddenly cried out: "Are
we never to have any fresh meat? His
Highness makes us thirsty enough, but
this salt meat quite finishes me. Wait
a moment! I am going to fetch you
here the thigh of one of those horses
which are burning over yonder. No
fear of their not being roasted enough!"</p>

<p>As he was springing up to do this,
his quick eye caught sight, just at
the edge of the wood, of a large
stag, which had come out of the forest,
attracted doubtless by Panurge's big bonfire. Carpalim ran towards
the stag with such fleetness that he seemed to have been shot from a
cross-bow, and caught up with him in a moment. Even while he was
bounding along, he was holding his hands up in the air, with all his
fingers spread open, and, in that way, he caught four great bustards,
seven bitterns, twenty-six gray partridges, sixteen pheasants, nine
snipes, nineteen herons, thirty-two red-legged partridges; and he killed
moreover with his feet, by kicking here and there, ten or twelve hares
or rabbits that chanced to start up in his path and hadn't time to get
away; fifteen tender young boars, and three large foxes. First killing
the stag by striking him on the head with his sword, he picked him up
and, while joyously returning along the road, gathered together his
hares, rabbits, boars, and foxes. And from as far as could be heard,
he began to cry out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Panurge! Panurge! <a id="Vinegar_Vinegar"></a>Vinegar! Vinegar!"</p>

<div class="caption">CARPALIM CATCHES SOME FRESH MEAT.</div>
</div>

<p>The good Pantagruel, having his back turned to the road, thought
from this that Carpalim surely must be sick, and so ordered that
vinegar should be at once brought. But Panurge, who happened
to be looking out, had already noticed what Carpalim had about
him, and told Pantagruel that his valet was carrying a fine stag
around his neck, and around his waist a belt of hares. Wise Master
Epistemon at once made nine handsome wooden spits in the old
style. Eusthenes, wanting to be useful, helped him to skin the
game; while Panurge placed two of the dead men's saddles in such
a way that they served as andirons. The prisoner
was made cook, and at the very same fire where
his friends were burning, the poor cook roasted
Carpalim's venison. Of course, everybody enjoyed the fresh meat
after so much salt meat, and became very gay and chatty. Panurge
evidently thought his friends were getting too noisy, for, of a sudden,
he cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We had better think a little about our affairs, so as to decide
in what way we will conquer our enemies."</p>

<p>"That is well thought on!" said Pantagruel.</p>

<p>He at once turned to the prisoner, and, wishing to frighten him still
more, said: "My friend, tell us here the truth, and do not lie to us in
any one single thing, if thou dost not want to be eaten alive, for they
say I am he who eats little children. Give us, therefore, the order, the
number, the strength in guns, of thy army."</p>

<p>"My lord," answered the prisoner humbly, "know for
truth that in my army there are three hundred
giants, all clad in armor, and
wonderfully tall giants they
are, too,&mdash;not quite so tall
as Your Highness, save one
who is their chief, who is
called Loupgarou, and who
is armed with anvils. Besides
these giants, there are
one hundred and sixty-three
thousand foot-soldiers, all armed
with the skins of hobgoblins, and
all strong and valiant men; eleven
thousand, four hundred men-at-arms;
three thousand, six hundred
double cannon, and quite too
many arquebusiers to count; and
ninety-four thousand pioneers."</p>

<p>"That is all very well, so far
as it goes," said Pantagruel, dryly;
"but is thy King there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sire, the King is there
in person. He is known among
us as Anarchus, King of the
<i>Dipsodes</i>, which is the same as
saying the Thirsty People, because
you have never yet seen a people so thirsty by nature or with
such throats for drinking. The giants guard the King's tent."</p>

<p>"Enough!" said Pantagruel. "Brave boys, are you willing to
follow me?"</p>

<p>"May Heaven confound those who would leave you!" cried out
Panurge.</p>

<p>Then the party began to joke one another about the prisoner's
report, and to boast about the glorious feats each one was going to do
on the giants who guarded King Anarchus' tent.</p>

<p>As was his habit the noble Pantagruel laughed at all the nonsense,
but, in the midst of a good shaking, he suddenly thought of what was
really before him.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, "you reckon without your host. I am
rather afraid that, if you go on much longer in the way you are now,
it will not be dark before you are in such a state that those Thirsty
People can come here and maul you with pike and lance. So, then,
children, let's be marching. However, before we leave this place, in
remembrance of the courage you have just shown, I wish to erect
here <a id="a_fine_trophy"></a>a fine trophy."</p>

<div class="caption">THE TROPHY.</div>
</div>

<p>This was a happy idea, and everybody was at once busy&mdash;singing
meanwhile pleasant little songs&mdash;in setting up a high post. This
done, they hung up on the post a great cuirassier saddle, the front-piece
of a barbed horse, bridle-bits, knee-pieces, stirrups, stirrup-leathers,
spurs, a coat of mail, a battle-axe, a strong, short, sharp sword, a
gauntlet, leg-harness, and a throat-piece,&mdash;all spoils from the poor
horsemen whose bones were then lying half-charred on the sands.</p>

<p>And this was the trophy which Pantagruel raised.</p>

<h4>THE STRANGE WAY IN WHICH PANTAGRUEL OBTAINED <a id="A_VICTORY_OVER_THE_THIRSTY_PEOPLE"></a>A VICTORY OVER
THE THIRSTY PEOPLE.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 187px;">
<img src="images/108.jpg" width="187" height="220" alt="Initial W" />
</div>

<p>When the trophy had been raised, Pantagruel
had his prisoner brought before him
and sent him away with these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get thee back to thy King in his
camp, and tell him what thou hast seen.
Be sure you tell him to be ready to welcome
me to-morrow, at noon. All I
am waiting for are my galleys, which,
are on the sea. As soon as they come,
which will be to-morrow morning, at
the very latest, I shall prove to thy
King, by eighteen hundred thousand
men and seven thousand giants,&mdash;each
of those giants taller and larger than thou see'st me here,&mdash;that he has
been an idiot to attack my country."</p>

<p>Of course, in all this talk about having an army on the sea, Pantagruel
was only trying to frighten the King of the Thirsty People.</p>

<p>The prisoner made haste to assure Pantagruel that he was his
humble slave, and that he would be only too glad, not only if he
never should see his people again, but, also, if he should be allowed
to fight under the Prince against them. Pantagruel shook his great
head at this. No! no! he must leave at once, and do what he had
been told to do. He gave him at the same time a box full of a
strange paste, made with some grains of black chameleon-thistle,
steeped in brandy, ordering him to place this in the hands of his
King, and say to him that, if he could eat even one ounce of the
mixture without wanting to drink after it, he would be able to resist
Pantagruel and <a id="his_whole_army_without_fear"></a>his whole army without fear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/109.jpg" width="296" height="400" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE KING OF THE THIRSTY PEOPLE.</div>
</div>

<p>Then the prisoner began to wring his hands, begging Pantagruel
in the hour of battle to have pity on him.</p>

<p>"After thou hast announced all to thy King," answered Pantagruel,
gravely, "put all thy trust in God,
and He will never forsake thee.
Look at me! I am, as thou canst
see, mighty. I can put millions
of troops in the field.
Yet I place no reliance
on my strength
or my skill; but all
my trust is in God,
my protector, who
never abandons those
who have their faith
in Him. Go, then,"
he added more kindly,
"and, if thou
wishest no evil to
happen to thee, turn
thy back on bad
company."</p>

<p>When the prisoner
had at last got
away, the good
Giant turned to his
friends, saying:
"My children, you know that I
do not tell lies; but it is always
lawful in war to deceive an
enemy. This is why I have made that prisoner believe we
had armies on the sea, and, also, that we were not going to
make an assault on their camp till to-morrow at noon. But I have
sent a paste that will put them all to sleep to-night, so that they
will not be prepared to receive my attack to-morrow, at noon.
My real purpose is to attack their camp in the hour of their first
nap."</p>

<p>But the prisoner&mdash;knowing nothing of all this side-talk&mdash;walked
quickly towards the city, which he soon reached, as you already know
it was only three leagues from the coast. As soon as he saw the
King, he began the story of how there had come a great Giant, who had
routed and caused to be cruelly roasted alive, six hundred and fifty-nine
horsemen; and how he, alone of all the troop, had escaped to
bring the terrible news. He then went on to state that that wonderful
Giant had charged him to say that he would look on His Majesty at
dinner-time, and wanted him to make ready for him. Then he presented
the box of paste, but, just as soon as the King had swallowed
one spoonful, his throat started to burn, and, after a while, his very
tongue began to peel off. What was to be done? There was only one
way out of the trouble, and that was for the King to drink&mdash;drink&mdash;drink,
without stopping! The result was that everybody was bringing
the King wine, and pouring it down his royal throat; and if ever he
stopped, the royal throat began to burn just as bad as ever. For the
Thirsty People, there could be nothing finer than such a sweetmeat, that
would make them drink, and drink, and drink again. Nothing would do
the pashas, captains, and guardsmen but that they should try the paste
to see whether it would produce such thirst in them; and the moment
they did so they were in the same fix as their King, and they all drank
so long that a rumor ran through the camp that the prisoner had come
back, and that a great attack was to be made the next day by some
terrible enemy, of whose name nobody knew. What could be better,
then, than to enjoy themselves the night before? So the captains and
the guards began to drink, and clink glasses, and give healths, until
they got stupidly drunk, and lay, here and there, where <a id="they_fell_as_so_many_swine_all_about_the_camp"></a>they fell, as so
many swine all about the camp.</p>

<div class="caption">THE SOLDIERS TRY PANTAGRUEL'S PASTE.</div>
</div>

<p>What was Pantagruel doing in the meanwhile?</p>

<p>As soon as he found that he could no longer see the prisoner
trudging along the road&mdash;and remember the eyesight of giants is just
so much keener than that of common men, as their bodies are stronger&mdash;Pantagruel
pulled out the mast from his ship, which he carried in
his hand like a pilgrim's staff, first putting in the hollow of it two hundred
and thirty-seven puncheons of white wine of Anjou. The next
thing he did was to tie to his waistband the bark itself, filled with salt,
which he carried as readily as women going to market carry their little
baskets of vegetables. When they got near the enemy's camp, Panurge
said: "My lord, do you wish to do a wise thing? Get that white
wine of Anjou down from that mast, and let us drink to our success."
Panurge was right in this, because, strong as Pantagruel was, such
a weight of wine would have only troubled him if he had to fight. He
was willing enough, and they drank so much of the delicious wine that,
at the end, there was not a single drop of the two hundred and thirty-seven
puncheons left except what was to be found in one leathern-flask,
which Panurge grabbed for his own private use, and hid away in his
pocket.</p>

<p>When the wine was gone, Pantagruel called out to Carpalim:
"Get thee into the city, scrambling over the walls like a cat, as thou
knowest well how to do. Tell our people in the city that now is the
very time for them to attack their foes, who are weak. As soon as
thou art through with them, seize a lighted torch, run through the
streets, and set fire everywhere. Don't forget to cry out with thy
loudest voice: 'Fire! Fire!' and skip from the camp."</p>

<p>Without another word, Carpalim was on the road, leaping and
bounding for the city. Everything was done as Pantagruel had commanded.
All the army in the city&mdash;that part which was not drunk&mdash;rushed
out of the walls to meet the foe, and found&mdash;nobody. Carpalim,
meanwhile, ran through all the tents and pavilions, setting fire to
each one. Of course, in doing so, he had now and then to step over
the captains and other officers who had eaten of Pantagruel's paste,
but he stepped so lightly, and they were so drunk, that they never
knew it. The tents caught fire so quickly that poor Carpalim&mdash;if it
had not been for his wonderful agility&mdash;would have been roasted alive,
like the captains, pashas, and guardsmen who were snoring in their
tents when he set fire to them.</p>

<p>When the army, that had been silly enough, when Carpalim
shouted, to run outside of the walls, reached the plain and found no
enemy, they wandered about in great confusion, and, being very
tired, at last returned to the city and lay outside of the burning tents,
and went to sleep with their mouths open. Nobody thought of taking
care of the burning gates. It was long after midnight when Pantagruel
entered the city, and as he marched through the streets he
would take bags of salt out of the ship, which he carried around
his waist, and, as he passed the sleepers, would drop the salt into their
open mouths. Many died from choking; and the rest of those who
were lucky enough not to be burnt, when they woke next morning,
thought they had enough salt in their mouths to last them for a lifetime.
All they said as they got up and humbly went about their business,
wetting their tongues every now and then to get the vile, bitter
taste out, was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Pantagruel, thou hast made our throats burn worse than
before!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 202px;">
<img src="images/111.jpg" width="202" height="232" alt="Initial A" />
</div>

<p>As soon as the body-guard of Giants saw
flames bursting from the tents, all they
could think of doing was to snatch up their
little King Anarchus, tie him to the neck
of one of them, and get out of the burning
city as fast as their long legs could take
them. Panurge, as usual, was the first
to see the Giants racing out of the city.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said, "just look at
those big rogues over there! All you
have to do is to charge with that mast
you have in your hand. You can have
no better way to prove your skill. We,
on our part, are not going to fail you."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" answered Pantagruel, "I do not lack courage. But
even Hercules did not dare fight against two, and here thou wouldst
have me fight against three hundred!"</p>

<p>"What!" retorted Panurge, while his tip-tilted nose curled higher
in the air than usual, "does Your Highness seriously mean to compare
yourself with Hercules? God has given you stronger teeth and
stouter limbs than ever Hercules had." Panurge was going to say
a good deal more, but here came Loupgarou with all his Giants.</p>

<p>When Loupgarou saw that Pantagruel was alone,&mdash;for, after all,
to the eyes of giants common-sized men, like Panurge, Epistemon,
Carpalim, and Eusthenes, must have looked like so many dwarfs,&mdash;he
felt sure that he would be able to make away with him. In fact, he was so
sure that he turned to his Giants, laughing all the time so as to show all
his big, cruel, yellow teeth. "By Mahomet! if any of you dare fight
with that great braggart over there, you shall die at these hands! I,
alone, wish to fight with him! Meanwhile, you shall have rare sport
in looking on."</p>

<p>Laughing loudly, the other Giants fell back a short distance,
where the wine and victuals had been left, carrying their little King along
with them. They had hardly got there when the cunning Panurge
and his friends, putting on a most humble, miserable look, crawled
up, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We surrender, good comrades. We have no taste for war.
All we ask is to join with you in feasting while our masters are
fighting."</p>

<p>The poor little King was willing; the Giants were willing; and
so they began to feast, Panurge and the others along with them.</p>

<p>Loupgarou had, by this time, advanced upon Pantagruel, with a
fearful mace of steel, weighing nine hundred and seventy thousand
pounds. At the end of the mace there were thirteen diamond points,
the very smallest of which was as big as the largest bell of the <i>Nôtre
Dâme</i>, in Paris. But what made that mace so terrible was, that it was
formed of fairy steel, so that it had only to touch the strongest thing
in the world to break it into pieces. But Pantagruel, as we know, put
his faith in God alone. As every good Christian, when he sees a fearful
enemy near him, calls upon God, so Pantagruel prayed to Him,
while Loupgarou was cursing furiously, to aid him who had always
loved the Church and obeyed the Ten Commandments. He had
scarcely ended his prayer when he heard a voice from the sky, saying:
"Have faith, and thou shall gain the victory."</p>

<p>By this time, Loupgarou, with his mouth wide open, was drawing
near him, and Pantagruel, who had no enchanted weapon, but only his
mast, thought to frighten the monster by crying out, as the old Lacedæmonians
used to do, in his most awful tones: "<i>Thou diest, rascal! Thou
diest!</i>" Even while he was saying this, he was digging his big hands
into the ship which he carried at his waist, from which he took more
than eighteen kegs and four bushels of salt, which he threw, filling
Loupgarou's mouth, throat, nose, and eyes. This only made Loupgarou
rage worse than ever. Roaring with pain and anger, he rushed against
Pantagruel, thinking to break his skull with his fairy mace. Pantagruel,
luckily, was both quick of foot and keen of eye. Seeing what
Loupgarou was at, he stepped with his left foot back one pace; but
even then he was not so quick as to save the ship. Loupgarou's blow
fell upon its prow, which was enough to smash it into
four thousand and eighty-six pieces, scattering,
of course, the rest of the salt
<a id="along_the_ground"></a>along the
ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/112.jpg" width="395" height="400" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE FIGHT WITH LOUPGAROU.</div>
</div>

<p>When Pantagruel saw his good ship
all in pieces he did not despair, but
gallantly attacked Loupgarou with its
mast, striking him two blows; one fell
above the breast, the other between neck
and shoulders. The monster did not relish
such treatment. So, when Pantagruel wanted
to give another blow in the same sharp style, Loupgarou raised his enchanted
mace and rushed upon him, knowing that he had only to touch
him with it to cleave him from head to foot. But, by God's blessing,
Pantagruel's nimbleness saved him here a second time. Stepping briskly
to one side, the terrible mace swept with a hissing noise through the air,
striking a great rock which stood in the way, into which it crashed
more than seventy-three feet, making a fire greater in bulk than nine
thousand and six tons flash from the hole it had made.</p>

<p>Here was another chance for Pantagruel.</p>

<p>Seeing that Loupgarou was tugging away at his enchanted mace to
pull it from the rock, Pantagruel ran towards him with his mast well-poised,
feeling sure that, this time, he would take off his head; but, by
bad luck, his mast just grazed the stock of Loupgarou's mace. Of
course it broke, and, what is worse, broke within three hand-breadths
of his own hand. Pantagruel was so much amazed at all this, as he had
never before heard that Loupgarou's mace was enchanted, that he cried
out, without very well knowing what he was doing: "Ho! Panurge,
where art thou?"</p>

<p>Panurge, whose eyes and cars had been stretched wide open ever
since the beginning of the fight, shouted out to the King and the
Giants: "By Heaven! if we don't get them apart, they will hurt one
another."</p>

<p>But the Giants, on their side, were in high chuckles. When
Carpalim wanted to get up to help his master, one of them said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Golfarim!"&mdash;who is the nephew of Mahomet,&mdash;"if thou
stir from here, I shall tuck thee in my belt."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pantagruel, having lost his staff, caught hold of the
little stump that was left of the mast, striking blows, here and there,
with it on the Giant's body. But the stump was so short that no harm
was done. Of course, all this time, Loupgarou was puffing and blowing
hard to pull his mace out from the rock. He at last succeeded.
All the time he was getting ready to swing it once more, he was bawling
out: "Villain! this time I shall surely kill thee! Never after this
shalt thou make honest people thirsty!" In trying to get his mace in
proper position to strike, he was, of course, bending a little.</p>

<p>Here was one more chance for Pantagruel; and Pantagruel
took it.</p>

<p>While Loupgarou had his body half-bent, Pantagruel gave him
such a kick in the stomach that he made him fall backwards, heels over
head, and as he began to drag him along the ground, Loupgarou was
bleeding at the throat, and could only find breath to call out three
times: "<a id="Mahomet_Mahomet_Mahomet"></a>Mahomet! Mahomet!! Mahomet!!!"</p>

<div class="caption">DEATH OF LOUPGAROU.</div>
</div>

<p>The moment they heard that cry, up started all the Giants to help
their leader; but now came Panurge's time to interfere.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, don't you go, if you have the slightest faith in me.
My master is mad, and is striking out blindly. He may hurt you
in his anger."</p>

<p>But the Giants only ha-ha'd at all this, having seen that poor Pantagruel's
only weapon, the mast, had been shivered to the handle by the
fairy mace. So, like idiots, they started in a body to Loupgarou's rescue.
The moment Pantagruel, who was just then breathing a little hard, saw
the Giants coming up, he caught Loupgarou's body, encased in an armor
of stout anvils, up by the two feet, lifting it high in the air with the same
ease as he might have raised a pike; and, with the master's own body, he
slashed around right and left among the Giants, knocking them down as a
mason chips with his hammer little bits off a stone. Not one of the Giants
could stand before Pantagruel without being struck flat to the ground.
While Pantagruel was performing such wonders with Loupgarou's body
and his armor of anvils, Panurge, together with Carpalim and Eusthenes,
were not idle. They, who had been so humble a few moments
before, were now going from one to the other of the party who lay
stretched on the ground, cutting the throats of such as had not fallen
quite dead. When the battle seemed to be at an end, up came a fearful
Giant, whom Pantagruel did not know, but who was so much taller and
stouter than his comrades that Loupgarou had made him his first officer.
Pantagruel felt perfectly safe with his new weapon; but, seeing how big
the Giant was, he gave an extra strong blow with the body, which sent
Loupgarou's head rolling on the ground. This new Giant was the last,
and that one strong blow killed him. Then Pantagruel, seeing that
none of the Giants had escaped, with one great swing of the arm,
threw the headless body into the city, which was not very far off.</p>

<p>It fell into the great Square, where it crushed with its weight one
singed cat, one wet cat, one lame duck, and one bridled goose.</p>

<p>After this marvellous victory, Pantagruel
sent Carpalim before him into the
city to let everybody know that King
Anarchus had been taken prisoner,
and that all his Giants had been killed.
On receiving this message, the people
flocked out of the walls to welcome their
own Prince. Everywhere, crowds were
making merry around fine, round tables,
filled with good victuals, and set out in
the middle of the streets. So good was
the cheer, and so bright were the bonfires
that blazed on every side, that the people
said it looked like the Golden Age come again. Pantagruel called the
wise men of the city before him. When they had gathered together,
he spoke these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My masters, I am not satisfied with getting back my own city. I
shall not rest until I capture all the cities, towns, and villages in the
Kingdom of the Thirsty People. I noted to-day that this city of yours
is so full of people that they can't turn about in the streets. I know
what I shall do for them. I shall plant my ancient and tried Utopians
as a colony in Dipsodie, so that they can teach the Thirsty People how

a vast multitude swarmed into the Great Square before the Palace to
the number of one million eight hundred and fifty-six thousand and
eleven&mdash;not counting the women and children. At break of day, this
great army was all ready to march in good order straight into the country
of the Thirsty People.</p>

<p>But, before they all get away. I must tell you one of the cunning
tricks of our old friend Panurge.
He had not forgotten
that the wretched
little King Anarchus, whom
Pantagruel had given to him
as a present, had been the
chief cause of the invasion
of the peaceful Kingdom
of Utopia. If Anarchus
had shown the spirit of a brave man
among the stout and faithful Giants, who had fought to the death to keep
his mean little body from harm, Panurge would never have dared touch
him. But Anarchus had been all along such a coward that he wasn't
worth anybody's pity. So, on the evening of Pantagruel's triumphant
entrance into the city, Panurge, after some hard thinking, got up a new
dress for the little King. There was nothing at all royal about the
dress. It was very far from being that, as it consisted of a pretty canvas
doublet, all braided and pranked out; a pair of wide sailor trousers;
and stockings without shoes.</p>

<p>"For," as Panurge said, "<i>shoes would only spoil his sight.</i>"</p>

<p>He then put on the head of Anarchus a little pink cap, trimmed
with a great capon-feather,&mdash;maybe I am wrong, because I have been
told that there were two of these feathers,&mdash;besides a fine belt of blue
and green. This was the ridiculous figure which Panurge dragged
before Pantagruel.</p>

<p>"Do you know this fellow?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said Pantagruel.</p>

<p>"Why, this is the King of the Thirsty People! I am going to
make an honest man of him. He was a pitiful rogue when he wore the
crown. Now that he wears this gay dress, he is an honest man. I have
given him a trade. He is a crier of green sauce, at your service.
Now, little King, begin! Call out, 'Green Sauce! Green Sauce!
Who wants to buy Green Sauce?'"</p>

<p>The poor King, from pure shame, piped out too low.</p>

<p>"That is not half loud enough," cried Panurge, catching him by the
ear, and saying, "Sing higher, little King; sing higher in <i>ge, sol,
re, ut.</i>"</p>

<p>Pantagruel made himself merry at all this. I dare say the little
King was the drollest man he had ever seen.</p>

<p>And this was how King Anarchus got to be a Crier of Green
Sauce.</p>

<p>Two days after this, Panurge married the little King with an old
lantern-jawed hag. To have everything pass off gaily, and to make
sure of good dancing, he hired a blind man to give the music. For
their wedding-supper, he ordered fine sheep-heads, plenty of eels served
with mustard, and tripe spiced with garlic. The drink was watered
wine and fine cider.</p>

<p>Pantagruel gave the couple a little cottage in one of the side streets,
and a stone-mortar in which to pound their sauce. Here they carried
on their trade, and the little King might have been happier than when
he lived in a palace and had Giants to guard him, but for his wife, who
beat him in time as flat as a mummy.</p>

<p>When Pantagruel marched from the city, along the high road, he
looked a grander and mightier Giant than ever. Every town and city
surrendered to him as he drew near, and every noble of the country
came to offer him homage. Only the city of the Almirodes held out;
and that would have kept its gates shut to the end had it not been for a
story its people happened to hear of the Giant and of an awful storm
which came up one day, while he was on his way there with his army.
There being no danger of <i>his</i> being drowned,&mdash;so the story ran,&mdash;Pantagruel
put his big tongue half way out of his mouth and covered
the whole army as snugly as a hen covers her chicks. When the people
of the stubborn city heard <i>that</i>, they opened their gates wide!&mdash;wide!!&mdash;wide!!!&mdash;to
let the Giant pass. "There is no use resisting such
a man as that," <a id="everybody_said"></a>everybody said.</p>

<p>And so ended the bad war which the Thirsty People had

their good King Gargantua
had been<a id="carried_to_Fairy-land"></a> carried
to Fairy-land.</p>

<p>Pantagruel, having ended his tour through all the
cities of his new Kingdom of Dipsodie, finally reached the Palace
where he had been born, and on leaving which, one sad day, to go on
his long journey to school, he had seen for the last time his dear and
honored father. All these thoughts made the tender-hearted Giant
sad; but he had no time for weeping. There were many wrongs in
his own Kingdom of Utopia to make right. There were many rights
to make strong. There were a thousand other things to do for his
faithful people, who had at once proclaimed him King when Gargantua
had been taken to Fairy-land,&mdash;even when he had been leagues upon
leagues away.</p>

</div>

<p>One day Gargantua came back from
Fairy-land.</p>

<p>It was a day above all others long
to be remembered by Pantagruel, when
he first heard, on coming home from a
visit to one of his cities, where he had
gone to decide a knotty case between
that city and a neighboring town, the
sharp bark of a dog. "Why! I know
that bark," he said. "That is the bark
of little Kyne, my father's dog. My
father must surely have come back!"
So, joyfully, he followed Kyne, who
went bounding and frisking back to the great door of the Palace. There
he found his old father, with his arms stretched wide open to clasp
his son. Everybody was glad to see that wonderful meeting of father
and son high up in the air.</p>

<p>"My dear son!"</p>

<p>"My dear and honored father!"</p>

<p>That was all they could hear, as the old Giant and the young
Giant, arm in arm, passed through the door, and went up the broad
stairway into the great hall. We may be sure that Snapsauce and
the two other Very Fat Cooks were soon doing their best to get
together a good dinner, during which Pantagruel heard all about
Fairy-land, its Queen, and her kind Fairies. When a fresh flagon of
wine rested between them, Father Gargantua said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I praise God, my beloved son, that he has given thee such wisdom
and virtue. Had it not been for thee, I would still have been
in Fairy-land, for thou hast been wise while I was away. I would like
to speak to thee now on a subject which much troubled me there.
Thou art now old enough to take a wife, and I desire to see thee
marry. Hast thou ever thought of a wife?"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, most dear father, I have never yet thought of
one. But, in choosing a wife, I am always thy son, and thou shalt
choose for me."</p>

<p>"I believe thee in that, my son. But thou shalt choose for thyself
when the time comes for a wife. When thou findest her, bring
her home; she shall find a father waiting for her."</p>

<p>Pantagruel stretched out one big hand across the table. It met
another big hand, only that other was more knotty and wrinkled than
his own. Then the two mighty hands clasped.</p>

<p>"But this is not all that I wanted to say, my boy. It is time thou
shouldst travel. Thou needest rest. Hast thou not been King in my
place?" The old Giant laughed as he said this. "Hast thou not filled
my throne, thou young rogue, for this score of years and more? Thou
art not so strong as thou wast; thou hast need of a holiday."</p>

<p>"Hast thou also thought, father, of a plan for all this whilst thou
wert in Fairy-land?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes. I had nothing else to do there but think. I know
thou dost love to travel and see strange things. Thou shalt start at
once. Don't crawl on land. Spread out thy white sails, and try the
seas. Take with thee thy friend Panurge,&mdash;he looks like a keen
fellow,&mdash;my old friend Friar John, my old master Ponocrates, who
would be better for a trip; also Master Epistemon, and such others
as thou pleasest. Put thy open hand into my treasure-box, and draw
out thy closed fist with what thou wantest of my gold. Thou wilt
find at my arsenal, Thalasse, all that thou needest; besides pilots,
sailors, and stout soldiers. At the first fair wind, set sail. When
thou art away, my boy, I shall make ready for thy wife, and for a
splendid feast when thou shalt bring her safe home."</p>

</div>

<p>A few days after this, Pantagruel said
good-by to Gargantua, leaving the old
Giant on his knees praying for his son.
He took with him Ponocrates, Panurge,
Epistemon, Gymnaste, Eusthenes, Rhizotome,
and Carpalim going with him of
course; fine old Friar John, who was
fond of saying that he could not sleep
o' nights unless he was in search of
some adventure; besides a famous traveler
named Xenomanes, who boasted
that he knew every land and every
sea that the earth, if it had a tongue,
could name. When he reached the sea-coast once more, Pantagruel
picked out the twelve largest vessels in Thalasse, and gathered together
all the pilots, mates, boatswains, sailors, workmen, soldiers, artillery,
ammunition, provisions, and clothes he needed for a long voyage.</p>

<p>The Flag-ship carried at its prow the strange figure of a gigantic
Bottle. Half of this bottle was of polished silver, the other half of
gold enamelled with crimson. From this every child in Thalasse&mdash;who
was a born sailor, and could read strange legends around the
prows of ships&mdash;ran about the streets in glee, shouting that the
Prince's colors would be white and red in the <a id="lands_to_which_he_was_going"></a>lands to which he was
going.</p>

</div>

<p>With James Brayer, the best pilot in the world, the fleet sailed
gaily away, with all its flags flying. It had all the way, except for
a few days near the Island of the Macreons, a fine, brisk wind, which
each day carried it farther toward India, the mysterious land in which
Pantagruel was going to seek a wife. On the fifth day, James Brayer
caught sight of an island, fair to see on account of the high, white
light-houses and towers, which rose so close together that the whole
coast shone like solid silver under the sun. On steering for the nearest
port, it was found that the new land was known as <a id="Medamothi_or_the_Island_of_Pictures"></a>Medamothi, or the
Island of Pictures.</p>

</div>

<p>"Island of Pictures!" exclaimed Pantagruel; "then we must
have some of them!"</p>

<p>While every ship's crew was hard at work taking in fresh water,
Pantagruel, with his friends, all in high good-humor at the prospect of
once more stepping on dry land, went on shore. They saw a great
crowd of people hurrying here and there, treading on each other's
heels, and filling all the streets and by-ways
<a id="leading_to_a_great_Square"></a>leading to a great Square.</p>

<div class="caption">LANDING AT THE ISLE OF PICTURES.</div>
</div>

<p>"What brings all you good people here?" asked Pantagruel of a
cripple, who was getting along as fast as he could hobble.</p>

<p>"Our great Fair, mighty Giant. Our Fair is held here every
year."</p>

<p>"Have you anything there worth the trouble of walking to see?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Your Highness.
Many wonderful things
are brought here by the great
merchants of Asia and Africa;
yes, and from all parts of the
world, too."</p>

<p>"We are in time, then, to see these wonderful things," said the Giant.</p>

<p>Once at the Fair, Pantagruel and his friends were delighted with
the number and variety of the finest tapestry pictures ever brought
together. There was nothing on the earth&mdash;whether men, country,
cities, palaces, farm-houses, mountains, ravines, valleys, lakes, trees,
flowers, birds, rivers, beasts, fishes&mdash;that was not to be found worked
in tapestry by skilful hands at that most wonderful of Fairs. Everybody
bought a picture,&mdash;Friar John, Epistemon, Eusthenes, Carpalim,
Panurge,&mdash;everybody, even Gymnaste, who had never before in
all his days seen tapestry. And it was here, while Pantagruel was
standing, deep in thought, before a bit of tapestry Epistemon had
bought, that Xenomanes came up and tried in every way to catch his
eye. All those around were too busy in making good bargains for
themselves with the merchants to help him; so, after half a dozen
efforts, he shook his white head gravely, and walked away.</p>

<p>It was Gymnaste who bought the largest and finest tapestry of all,
representing the "Life and Feats of Achilles," in seventy-eight pieces,
eight yards long and six yards wide, all made of Phrygian silk, embossed
with gold and silver.</p>

<p>"Is that fit for a rough fellow like thee, Gymnaste?" asked
Panurge, with his nose turned up in scorn.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest better than that, Panurge! It is a present from
our noble lord to his royal father, which I have bought on his order."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Panurge, while his nose turned up still higher in
a bright red end, and stayed that way until dinner-time, when it turned
down a bit, but got redder than ever before the meal was over.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Island of Pictures, Pantagruel bought three fine
young unicorns, which were the tamest of all creatures, and a splendid
reindeer which, with great care, had been brought all the way from
frozen Scythia. There never has been a reindeer like this reindeer
from Scythia! It could change its color at any time, not because it
wanted, or knew it was doing so, but only because it could not help
changing whenever a new color came near it. For instance, when
Panurge, in his gray kersey coat, would draw near to stroke it, its
hair would turn gray too. Near Pantagruel, dressed grandly out in
his great scarlet mantle, the reindeer would blaze out red. When
James Brayer, in his long, white
gown, happened to come near the
beast, there, in a few seconds,
was the reindeer from Scythia turning white before everybody's eyes!
Pantagruel was very proud to be the owner of such treasures; and,
after he had once got the tapestry for his father, the wonderful reindeer,
and the three unicorns, as playful as young kittens, safely on
board, he gave the order for the fleet <a id="to_sail_from_the_Island_of_Pictures"></a>to sail from the Island of
Pictures.</p>

<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL BUYS SOME STRANGE ANIMALS.</div>
</div>

<p>Pantagruel had been so taken up with these strange animals that
it was not until he was on his way to the port that he remembered that
Xenomanes had tried to catch his eye. At once turning to him, he
said kindly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your pardon, great traveller; what did you wish to say to me?"</p>

<p>"Only this, my lord, that seeing so many tapestry pictures, I was
reminded of that strange Land of Satin which I once visited. I know
Your Highness to be a great lover of travels, and always glad to
learn new things. It was for this reason I ventured to disturb you."</p>

<p>"Why!" said Pantagruel, at once interested, "were there as
many wonderful things in your Land of Satin as there are in this
Land of Pictures?"</p>

<p>"What I tell you, my lord, is strange but true. In the Satin
Land, the trees and herbage never lose their leaves or flowers, and are
all damask and flowered velvet. As for the beasts and birds, they all
looked to me like what we saw in those pictures. I saw many beasts,
birds on trees, of the same color, size, and shape of those in our
country. There was one difference, however, between them. Those
in Satin Land ate nothing, and never sang or bit like ours."</p>

<p>"And the people of that land, Xenomanes, what of them?"</p>

<p>"This I cannot tell Your Highness."</p>

<p>"Ho! and why?"</p>

<p>"Never a word could I ever get from those people. There I saw
many philosophers, travellers, and students, with whom I would gladly
have spent half an hour in learned converse. They all seemed to be
full of business, running about hither and yon, and yet had little to
do."</p>

<p>"And what do those busy, silent people live on?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how they contrive to <i>live</i>, Your Highness, for once
I tried a bunch of their fine ripe cherries. They had no manner of
taste, and, although I was hungry enough that day, I could neither
chew nor swallow them, but my mouth
seemed filled with what I could have
sworn was <a id="tufted_silk"></a>tufted silk."</p>

</div>

<p>Five days after leaving the Land of Pictures,
the flag-ship being in the lead,
Pantagruel's keen eyes caught sight, away
off to the windward, of a large merchant-ship
making her way slowly towards
them. There was great joy among all
the men on all the ships. Those on the
fleet were glad, because they hoped,
through the sail in sight, to hear news
of the sea; and those on the merchant-ship
because her passengers expected
to get news from the main-land. When
the flag-ship met with the stranger,
and when the two were side by side, Pantagruel, curious to see a
merchantman, went with his friends on board the latter.</p>

<p>The skipper of the merchantman, cap in hand, told Pantagruel
that he had come from Lanternland. As soon as this was known
everybody tried to put in a question about the country,&mdash;how it had
got its name, and what were the habits of the Lantern people. It
was learned that, towards the end of each July, the Lanternists held
their great Fair, which, if the Giant wished to see for himself how
much could be made of lanterns, whether single or strung in rows,
by twos; by threes; by fours, and so on; or piled in columns; or
ranged in arches; or spanning streets; or hung on trees; or sparkling
on country roads; or swinging along the whole coast, making it
as bright as in sunshine,&mdash;why, all he would have to do was to go
there, if not that year, then the next.</p>

<p>While all this pleasant little talk was going on between the
Giant and the skipper, Panurge had already got into a wrangle with
a French sheep-seller, named Dindeno, who happened to have a large
cargo of sheep on board. This sheep-seller was a very bad-tongued
fellow; and, seeing Panurge passing by, with his glasses tied to his cap,
and looking at his stock, he called out sneeringly to his shepherds,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just look at that long-nosed dandy, with his glasses tied to
his cap!"</p>

<p>Panurge, whose ears were as keen as his nose was sharp, retorted,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What dost thou say, thou sheep-barber?</p>

<p>"Sheep-barber! Ha! I am no sheep-barber, I let thee know,
thou long-nosed dandy."</p>

<p>"Thou art no sheep-barber, eh! Prithee, tell me, then, rude
fellow, what are so many sheared sheep doing here? Who sheared
them, if thou didst not?"</p>

<p>"Thou art a rogue; and I will kill thee as I would a ram!"
shrieked the sheep-seller, while trying to draw his sword; but the
blade stuck close to the scabbard, as often happens on sea, from the rust
caused by salt-water. Panurge, who was not armed, and who, from
his cradle, had been a coward, ran for safety towards Pantagruel, who
was not looking at what was going on. But Friar John, always on the
watch, with his strong arm caught hold of Dindeno. Then Pantagruel,
turning round and seeing a man struggling with Friar John, knew
for the first time that there was a quarrel. At this moment the
skipper stepped up, and, with many bows and prayers that there
should be no bad name given to his ship, begged his Giantship to
order peace. This was done, and Panurge and Dindeno shook hands,
apparently the best of friends.</p>

<p>A short time after, Panurge winked at Epistemon and Friar
John, as much as to say, "I want to have a word with you." As
soon as they came near, Panurge whispered, "Stand about here for
a while, and you shall see rare sport."</p>

<p>Having no idea of what was coming, Friar John and Epistemon
stepped to one side, and waited.</p>

<p>Then Panurge, turning to Dindeno, begged him to be good
enough to <a id="sell_him_one_of_his_sheep"></a>sell him one of his sheep.</p>

<div class="caption">PANURGE WANTS A SHEEP.</div>
</div>

<p>"Hello! my good friend and neighbor," cried the sheep-seller,
"dost thou want to play tricks on poor people? How long since thou
hast been a buyer of sheep?"</p>

<p>"Whatever I may have been," said Panurge, gently, "be so kind
as to sell me one of thy sheep there. Now, how much wilt thou ask
for one?"</p>

<p>"See here, friend and neighbor, these are noble creatures.
These are long-wooled sheep. It was from the fathers of these very
sheep that Jason took his famous Golden Fleece."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt thy word," said Panurge; "but fix thy price for
one of those precious sheep. Here is thy money ready for thee."</p>

<p>"My friend and neighbor, now listen to me!"</p>

<p>"I am listening."</p>

<p>"I shall make a bargain with thee! We have a pair of scales
on board. Get thee on one scale. I shall put my
prize ram on the other. I am willing to bet thee a
peck of Busch oysters that, in weight, value, and
general worth, my ram shall outweigh thee!"</p>

<p>"That may be all so; but I beg thee,
good Dindeno, without further word, to
be so kind as to sell me one of thy sheep;
I care not which one."</p>

<p>With that, he pulled out his purse,
and showed it bursting with new
gold-pieces, with the face of
good King Gargantua stamped
on each piece.</p>

<p>Dindeno's eyes flashed
at the glitter of so much
gold; but he had made up
his mind to insult Panurge
until he made him angry.</p>

<p>"My friend and neighbor,"
he said, "my sheep are meat
only for kings and princes. They are too nice and dainty for such
as thou."</p>

<p>"Be patient now, and please grant my request. Only set thy
price for one, and I will pay thee like a king."</p>

<p>"Thou art a fine fellow, truly," sneered Dindeno; "but tell me
first, hast thou ever seen such shoulders, such legs, such knuckles, such
backs and breasts as thou canst see here? Such strong ribs, out of
which the small people in Pigmy-land make cross-bows to shoot with
cherry-stones those long-legged cranes in their country? Think of all
this for a second!"</p>

<p>"Peace, good man, I pray thee!" Panurge was about to say
more, when he was stopped all of a sudden by the skipper, who had just
drawn near at the sound of loud voices, and had heard Dindeno's sharp
tones. "Enough! Enough! Too much talk here!" he cried. "Dindeno,
if thou wantest to sell, sell. If thou wilt not, have done with it."</p>

<p>"I am willing to sell, Captain, for thy sake; but for thy sake
alone," said the sheep-seller. "But he must pay me three French
livres for his pick and choice."</p>

<p>"That is a big price," said Panurge, gently. "In my own country,
I can buy five, nay, six fine rams for that much money."</p>

<p>"But not such sheep as mine!" yelled Dindeno, who was getting
very angry that he had not vexed Panurge.</p>

<p>"Really, sweet sir, thou art getting a little warm. Come, now,
the bargain is ended. Here is thy price. <a id="Give_me_my_ram"></a>Give me my ram."</p>

<p>Dindeno, in clutching angrily at the money, rudely pulled it out
of the hands of the patient Panurge. Holding himself as straight as
he could, with an innocent smile upon his face, Panurge&mdash;having at
last got what he wanted&mdash;looked around to make his choice. He soon
picked out the finest ram in all the flock. The moment he caught hold
of his ram, and began to haul it along, the poor beast set up a pitiful
bleating. As soon as the rest of the sheep heard their leader bleating,
they, too, set to crying and bleating, while staring at him with all their
eyes wide open. Meanwhile, Dindeno, full of rage, was whispering to
his shepherds,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That long-nosed fellow knows how to choose! That ram he
has taken was the very one I had put aside for my best friend, the
Lord of Cancale!"</p>

<p>As quick as lightning&mdash;before anybody knew what he was about;
even before Dindeno in fact, had turned away from whispering to his
shepherds&mdash;Panurge had caught up his bargain, bleating louder than
ever, and thrown it overboard into the sea. At this, all the other
sheep on the ship, crying and bleating just in the same sad key as
their leader, began to scamper to the side and leap into the sea one
after another. It was, with all of them, "Who shall be first after our
leader?" it being the nature of sheep, which are the silliest creatures
in the world, always to <a id="follow_their_leader"></a>follow their leader.</p>

</div>

<p>When Dindeno turned round and saw his precious sheep frisking
and drowning themselves before his eyes, he was at his wits' end. He
tore his hair, and called out to his shepherds, "Help me save my sheep!
help me!" Then he ran forward, and tried to keep, by might and
main, the sheep from jumping into the sea; but it was all in vain.
One after the other frisked gaily forward, bleating sadly all the while,
to the spot where they had seen Panurge throw their leader overboard.
At last Dindeno, in his despair, caught hold of a big ram by the fleece,
hoping to be able to keep him back, and, in that way, to save the rest.
But the ram was stronger than Dindeno, and bore him away with him
into the sea, where both were drowned.</p>

<p>This was, of course, bad enough; but there was something worse
to come. All of Dindeno's shepherds rushed forward to save the
sheep, some catching them by the horns, some by the fleece, others
by the legs, others still by their stumpy tails. It mattered little
which way the poor innocent shepherds caught hold of the sheep, the
sheep were too much for them, and they were all carried overboard
into the sea, and <a id="drowned_along_with_their_master"></a>drowned along with their master.</p>

<p>All this time Panurge was standing near the galley of the ship,
holding an oar in his hand. This was not, you may
well believe, to keep the poor shepherds from drowning. No! no!
Panurge was not so soft-hearted as <i>that!</i> He used his oar only to keep
the sheep from swimming up to the ship, crying out all the time,&mdash;"Drown,
foolish sheep, drown! It is sweeter to drown than to
live and be butchered, you foolish sheep!"</p>

<p>Wicked Panurge! He never once thought of Dindeno and the
innocent shepherds!</p>

<p>After the slaughter of Dindeno, his
shepherds, and his sheep, Pantagruel
returned to his ship, and continued on
his way to that land where he was hoping
soon to meet the lovely Princess, whose
beauty had reached his ears from far
India. As to the affair on board the
merchant-ship, nobody could be found
who was really to blame. Panurge put
on his most innocent look, and declared
to Pantagruel that he had only done
what he had a perfect right to do,&mdash;thrown
his own ram overboard.</p>

<p>With a spanking breeze, the fleet made great speed. On the third
day a triangular island, having something of the shape of Sicily about
it, was sighted. Pantagruel and his friends, on landing, were met by
one who called himself the Mayor, who came puffing, and all red in the
face from the haste he had made to get to the harbor, as soon as he
heard that a strange craft was in port.</p>

<p>"What is the name of this queer, three-cornered land, and who are
its queer-nosed people?" whispered Panurge, sharply twitching the
Mayor by the sleeve, as he was making his twelfth bow to Pantagruel.
Nothing ever pleased the Mayor more than to be called upon for an
account of the island and its people. He had written a little history
for the benefit of travellers, and knew every page of it by heart. In
his own mind, he at once put Panurge down as a very gifted personage,
although he was willing to grant that Pantagruel was the tallest and
the noblest man who had ever stepped on the island. Bowing to
Panurge, therefore, very politely, and having learned that it was
Pantagruel's wish for him to go on, he gave them an account as he led
them from one point of interest in the island to the other.</p>

<p>According to the Mayor, the island was known as the "Island of
Alliances." It used to be called, in the old times, "Island of the Noseless
People," from the fact that the noses of all the men and women and
little children were flat, and shaped like the ace of clubs. The island
was small, but it was full of people, and had been inhabited for many
thousand years. As ages rolled by, it was found to be of no use to try
and keep up the family names; for, as there was no difference in the
faces,&mdash;since all, big and little, rich and poor, had the same kind of
club-nose, dumped exactly in the middle of the face,&mdash;nobody could
claim any particular name. In their trouble, through much thinking,
they at last formed a plan by which they could tell one from another.</p>

<p>This was their plan:&mdash;</p>

<p>They made up their minds to forget altogether, as unworthy of
them, such barbarous relationships as father, mother, sister, brother,
uncle, aunt, etc., and to call each other by the name of whatever one
most wanted. In this way, the people of the island became as one
family. So loving did they grow under this new rule that each one
seemed to have a certain right to his neighbor, and never spoke to him
without putting "<i>my</i>" before his name. If a little girl, for instance,
wanted butter for her bread, she would call her mother "my <i>Butter</i>;"
if the mother wanted her thread, the call, "my <i>Thread</i>," would bring
the little girl running to find it for her. A young man would bow to a
young lady, and say, "A lovely day, my sweet <i>Evening Walk</i>," and
she would smile, and reply, "Yes, my <i>Fairest Nosegay</i>." An old man
would call to his son, "Hurry, my <i>Staff</i>," and the boy would answer,
"At once, coming, my <i>Purse</i>;" a learned professor would call his
class to recite by ringing his bell for "My <i>Good Lessons</i>," and each
scholar would salute him respectfully, as he marched into his room,
with "Good-morning, my <i>Success</i>." A hungry man would call the
bar-maid, "Quick, my <i>Oysters</i>," and she would answer, "Yes, my
<i>Sixpence</i>."</p>

<p>There could be no trouble under this new and wise law, for
everything&mdash;even in the smallest matters&mdash;worked smoothly.
There could be no sad marriages, because each one called for in the
other what he or she most needed, and did not have. Young men and
maidens danced and sung half the year round, since they were always
calling each other, "My gay <i>Holiday</i>" and "My rich <i>Feast</i>." The
children, too, were happy, and laughed and played from eye-opening
to eye-shutting time; old men and women talked around the fireside
of the time when they were young, tenderly calling each other, "My
dear gossip <i>Snuff</i>" and "My good neighbor <i>Pipe</i>." So close together
did this people get to be that, in case of need, over three hundred
thousand men, whose boast was that they all belonged to the same
family, could march out of the city gates. So, at least, <a id="the_Mayor_of_Club-noses_declared"></a>the Mayor of
Club-noses declared.</p>

</div>

<p>Good Pantagruel kept his eyes fixed upon the Mayor, and his ears
open to all that he was saying; but, at this last boast of three hundred
thousand men in one family, he slightly frowned, and came near losing
his usual sweet temper. The wordy Mayor, frightened by the awful
eyebrows about to meet together, began to feel a strange thirst; and,
making a very low bow, proposed a cup of good-cheer at a neighboring
inn.</p>

<p>After some twenty or thirty bumpers each, Pantagruel's party
all went on board, and sailed at once, right before the wind, from the
Island of Alliances, without stopping to see any more of its queer-nosed
people.</p>

<h4>HOW PANTAGRUEL CAME TO THE ISLANDS OF TOHU AND BOHU.&mdash;THE
STRANGE DEATH OF WIDENOSTRILS,<a id="THE_SWALLOWER_OF_WINDMILLS"></a> THE SWALLOWER OF WINDMILLS.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 202px;">

</div>

<p>Pantagruel stopped at two islands
named Tohu and Bohu, which lay very
close together. There had always
seemed to be a somebody, or a something,
very wonderful in the islands he
had already passed; but there happened
to be a more wonderful somebody in
Tohu and Bohu than he had seen or heard
of in any other place. When Pantagruel
landed with his friends at the quay
of the principal town, where the chief
men came to see him, he called for
dinner; but behold! there was no dinner
to be had. Why? Why, there was nothing to cook the dinner in!</p>

<p>"How is that, my friend?" Pantagruel asked the chief man.</p>

<p>"Because," he answered, "Your Highness has not brought your
frying-pan along with you."</p>

<p>"My frying-pan along with me! Why, what do you mean?
What has my frying-pan to do with the dinner you are to serve me?"</p>

<p>"A great deal, Your Highness, since we have no pans of our own."</p>

<p>"Did you ever have any?"</p>

<p>"Any number, Your Highness, any number; but Widenostrils
has just eaten our last one."</p>

<p>"Has just eaten your last one, you say? Pray who is this
Widenostrils who has a fancy for gobbling frying-pans?"</p>

<p>"A wicked giant, almost as tall as Your Highness, who has
swallowed all our windmills."</p>

<p>"But windmills are not frying-pans, friend?"</p>

<p>"No, Your Highness is quite right there; but I was just about to say
that, when there were no more windmills to swallow, this wicked giant
took to shovelling every skillet, kettle, frying-pan, dripping-pan, and
brass and iron pot in the land down his big throat, and all for want of
windmills, which were his daily food. That made him very sick. It
almost killed him. We hoped it had killed him outright; but it didn't.
But he is dying, now, sure enough."</p>

<p>"Dying of what?" asked Pantagruel; "of eating frying-pans and
skillets?"</p>

<p>"I wish it was! Some people do say so; but others, who are
fishermen, and who live on the coast, and know everything that happens,
declare that our giant went, a month ago, to another island, where he
has been going for years, to swallow windmills, and vex the poor
people there, and that he took in, with his last batch of windmills, I
don't know how many cocks and hens. Now that I remember, I did
hear that his own doctor made the choking worse by making him
eat a big lump of fresh butter too near a hot oven. All this is very
strange, though&mdash;I can't quite make it out myself."</p>

<p>"Where is that great Widenostrils? I should like to see him."</p>

<p>"In yonder meadow. Your Highness will find him very sick."</p>

<p>Pantagruel and his friends crossed over to the meadow, and there
found, under the blazing sun, an enormous giant stretched along the
ground, breathing heavily through the most awful nostrils human eyes
had ever seen; and every time he breathed through his nostrils they
flapped with a loud noise, like a sail when the wind shifts. The giant
looked, as he lay there, very tough and wooden-like, as though the
thousands of windmills he had gulped down in his time had gradually
turned his body into wood. When they came near him, Widenostrils
opened his eyes for a moment, first lazily, as he saw Panurge and the
other little men about him, then wildly rolling them around, in fearful
efforts to see the whole of the Giant, whose legs he had first caught
sight of. It was only for a moment though; for Widenostrils was
dying. He half-rose on his elbows, quivering through all his big body,
his nostrils all drooping and shutting close for want of air, yet
found strength enough to yell out, "Magic, magic! Protect me,
brother Giant! Cocks and hens are fluttering inside of me! Cocks
and hens are crowing and cackling within me! I am
be&mdash;&mdash;!" He was going to say <i>bewitched</i>, but he fell
back with a thump, which shook the two islands to their centre, deep
under the sea, and made the people in distant lands swear, ever after,
that there had been a <a id="terrible_earthquake_on_that_day"></a>terrible earthquake on that day.</p>

<div class="caption">GIANT WIDENOSTRILS, THE SWALLOWER OF WINDMILLS.</div>
</div>

<p>When Panurge saw Widenostrils fall back dead,&mdash;but not until
then,&mdash;he went to the body, and, scrambling on its stomach, with the
aid of Gymnaste, listened carefully for a few moments. Then, jumping
down, he said to Pantagruel:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord, this Widenostrils; this fine swallower of windmills;
this eater of pans, and glutton of pots, is really dead! But I can
swear that there are some things much like crowing cocks and cackling
hens rummaging inside of his big body. Once I heard something very
much like a quick yelp followed by a sharp screech."</p>

<p>Pantagruel seemed not to hear Panurge, for he stood a long time
looking down at the body of a giant, who, when living, must have
been nearly as tall as himself. On turning away, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wonder where this wicked man, who loved windmills, and died
from skillets, ever swallowed those fowls he talked about."</p>

<p>He did not leave the island until he had ordered the dead giant
honorable burial in the meadow where he had died. But he did not
wait for the funeral. If Widenostrils had been a good giant, he would
have acted as chief mourner; but he had a fixed rule which he expressed
by saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Giants should always be brotherly with Giants, but only with
good Giants."</p>

<p>The next morning the fleet started from
Tohu and Bohu, cheered by the people,
who were all in the best humor, because
Pantagruel had left among them
a new stock of frying-pans and skillets,
so shining that they could see their
faces in them. The sky was bright;
the wind was fair; the very sea seemed
to laugh,&mdash;all the fleet was happy. But
Pantagruel sat on deck, looking very
sad.</p>

<p>Friar John was the first to notice
how still Pantagruel was. On seeing
his Prince so glum, the good Friar, who was always a comforting kind
of man, was just about asking him the reason, when James Brayer, the
pilot, after cocking one eye at the sea, and the other at the sky, and
then turning both eyes up towards the flag drooping on the poop, as
though it would never wave again, knew that a storm was coming on,
and, therefore, bid the boatswain pipe all hands on deck, and even
summon the passengers.</p>

<p>"In with your top-sails!" he shouted. "Take in your spritsail!
lower your foresail! lash your guns fast!"&mdash;all of which was done as
quick as hands could do it.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, as though a great hand from above had swept down
to stir the waters and make them mad, the sea began to swell, and
moan and roar, and rise up into mountains, and sink into valleys. An
awful north-west wind had got caught in with a hurricane,&mdash;so James
Brayer said,&mdash;and the two together whistled through the yards, and
shrieked through the shrouds. The sky itself seemed to be splitting
open, and dropping down thunder, lightning, rain, and hail. In broad
daylight it grew all dark, and the water rose to mountains, and sank to
the depths in perfect blackness, save for the great flashes of lightning
that showed the white faces of men, and the whiter foam of the sea.</p>

<p>It looked as though the end of the world had come, and that those
on the sea had been <a id="the_first_to_know_it"></a>the first to know it.</p>

<div class="caption">A STORM COMES ON.</div>
</div>

<p>James Brayer soon had every one about him busy at the work of
saving the flag-ship. Even Pantagruel was pressed into service. It
was no time for ceremony; the danger was too great for that. James
Brayer bawled through his trumpet:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord, I must ask you to stand amidship. Your Highness is
so heavy that, in a sea like this, whichever side of the ship you may
be on is bound to keel over. The sea is mad,&mdash;I have never seen it
so mad before!"</p>

<p>Pantagruel, in the midst of all this shouting of men, and raging
of the waves, and shrieking of the winds, was kneeling perfectly quiet,
but praying with all his good heart to the Almighty Deliverer to save
them. Hearing James Brayer call, he at once rose from his knees,
and said cheerfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here I am, good pilot! But how am I to stand amidship without
interfering with the handling of the ship?"</p>

<p>"Easily enough, Your Highness. All you have to do is to put
your arms around the <a id="mainmast_and_stand_still"></a>mainmast, and stand still."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/135.jpg" width="375" height="400" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL HOLDS THE MAST.</div>
</div>

<p>This Pantagruel did, holding the mast firmly with both hands,
and keeping it straighter than two hundred tacklings could have done.
Everybody worked hard,&mdash;everybody except cowardly Panurge, who,
when the sea first began to churn, sank upon deck all in a heap, more
dead than alive. He could do nothing but whine and cry <i>boo! boo! boo!
boo!</i> and call upon Heaven to save him. In the meanwhile, all the
others were as busy as beavers,&mdash;Friar John, Gymnaste, Carpalim,
Xenomanes, even Epistemon and old Ponocrates himself! All did
wonders; but nobody worked like Friar John during all the storm;
so, at least, declared James Brayer. Why, Friar John even pulled
off his monk's gown, a thing he had, until then, been known to do only
once, and that was when he saved the Abbey-Vineyard. "It bothers
me, and I can't work in it," he said, as he pulled it off. With his
waistcoat for a coat, he stood at his post with strong arm and cheery
word for everybody. Every now and then he would glance at Panurge,
still squatted on deck and crying, "<i>Boo! boo! boo! boo!</i> Friar
John, my friend, good father, I am drowning. <i>Boo! boo! boo!</i> The
water has got into my shoes. <i>Boo! boo! boo! boboo!</i> I drown!
Oh, how I wish I was a gardener, and planted cabbages, for then I
would be sure of always having at least <i>one</i> foot on land! Oh, my
friend, the keel goes up to
the sun. I hear the hull
splitting. We are all
drowned! <i>Boo! boo!
boo! holos! holos!</i>" At
last Friar John's patience
gave out,&mdash;it was
at the close of the
sixth hour he had
been working,&mdash;and
he roared out to
Panurge:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What art thou
bellowing there
for, like a
calf? Panurge
the
cry-baby,
Panurge the whiner, would it not better become thee to help thyself
and friends? Come, be a man!"</p>

<p>Just then a huge sea broke on the deck. Panurge was too frightened
even to look up. All the answer he could give to Friar John
was, "<i>Boo! boo! boo! boboo!</i> The ship is capsized! <a id="I_drown"></a>I drown!"</p>

<div class="caption">A SEA BREAKS OVER PANURGE.</div>
</div>

<p>At that moment, Pantagruel's voice was heard even above the
storm, so mighty was it in prayer: "Save us, good Lord, if it be Thy
will." The Giant's prayer must have been heard. The thunder still
crashed; the lightning still blazed; the rain still poured; but it was
not half so bad as before. The sea still rose; but it rose in hills, not
mountains, now. Pantagruel still stood, as he had from the first, with
his arms clinging to the mainmast while he braced it up, and his eyes
trying to pierce through the blackness. At last, just as the day broke,
he shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Land! land! My children, I see land! We are not far from
port. I can see the sky clearing up southwards. Cheer up, all!"</p>

<p>James Brayer was at his side <a id="as_quick_as_lightning"></a>as quick as lightning.</p>

<p>"Up, lads!" he shouted. "Our prince sees land, and the sea
is smoother. We can put out a trifle of sail. Hands aloft to the
maintop! Mind your steerage; clear your sheets; port, port! Helm-a-lee!
Steady, steady!" And steady it was, too. Before all eyes
on the ship land was now to be seen in full sight, some twenty miles
off. The sun was just beginning to shine a little. The sea was no
longer mad. It was only sobbing, sobbing, sobbing, as though half-ashamed
it had so troubled the good Giant who <a id="knew_how_to_pray"></a>knew how to pray.</p>

<p>While Panurge was blustering, and making believe that he had not
been crying and blubbering all during the storm, Pantagruel and his
company were paying no attention to him, but were making everything
ready to go on shore. On landing they were met most kindly by the
people of the island, which turned out to be a small one, known as the
Island of Macreons, Macreon being a Greek word meaning an "old
man." Therefore, the Island of Macreons was only another name for
the "Island of Old Men." A venerable Macreon, with long white
beard, reaching to his waist, who was the High Sheriff of the island,
stepped forward, and gravely invited Pantagruel to go with him to the
Town Hall, where he could take a rest after his fatigue, and be sure of
a little luncheon afterwards. But the Giant would not leave the quay
until all his men had got ashore, and with enough provisions to last
them while at work on the ships, which needed many repairs after the
storm. This was done at once, and then began the carouse both in the
Town Hall and among the men along the quay. There is no telling
now how much was really eaten and drunk during that day; but there
was enough for every one. The people of the island brought their
victuals. The Pantagruelists brought theirs. It was something more
than a lunch, as it turned out. It was a real picnic on a large scale;
everybody giving his share of the feast, and making the most of what
the others brought.</p>

<p>After the meal Pantagruel took his officers aside, and told them
that, as the ships had been strained by the storm, they should set to
work to make them sound again. As soon as the people of the island
heard of the trouble many offered to help. This they could easily do
as they were all, more or less, carpenters, having <a id="a_large_forest_behind_three_very_small_ports"></a>a large forest behind

<div class="caption">THE DARK AND GLOOMY FOREST.</div>
</div>

<p>At Pantagruel's request the white-bearded Macreon, whose name
was Macrobius, showed him all that was strange or wonderful
in the island. Leaving the harbor, he took the Giant into the dark
and gloomy forest, which was found at the entrance to be full of
ruined temples, obelisks, pyramids, and crumbling tombs. Over
most of these were inscriptions and epitaphs, some in strange letters,
none could read, not even Panurge; others in Ionic characters; others
in the Arabic; others in the Icelandic. "Our
heroes come," the old man explained, "<a id="from_every_land_on_the_earth"></a>from every
land on the earth."</p>

<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL IN THE GRAVEYARD.</div>
</div>

<p>Macrobius asked Pantagruel how it was that
he and his fleet could have survived the awful
storm and reached port, when the Macreons could see that all the
air and the earth were in wild uproar. Pantagruel answered, with
that simple faith of his which gives the smallest dwarf the strength
of the tallest giant, "Friend, it was God's will." After which, he
asked him whether these great storms were common around their
coast.</p>

<p>The old man then told a very sad tale.</p>

<p>"Pilgrim," he said, in a broken voice, "this poor island of ours
was once rich, great, and full of young people. Now there are no
young people in it, and it is only full of old men like myself, and of
shadows that we can feel, but never can see; shadows that we love, but
never can know; shadows that move about in yonder forest you see
stretched out before you, and, when their hour comes, die in its darkest
depths. No common shadow ever yet lived or ever yet died in our
forest. It is the dwelling-place only <a id="of_heroes_and_of_demons"></a>of heroes and of demons."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/142.jpg" width="400" height="262" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE DEMONS AND THE HEROES.</div>
</div>

<p>"Of heroes and demons?" cried Pantagruel, amazed.</p>

<p>"Yes, of heroes, who, after being great on earth and seeming to
die there, come here to live another life, and to suffer, and to show
themselves great for a final trial; and of demons who are given power
to roam the forest at will, only to mock, and laugh, and lure, if they
can, the heroes to sin."</p>

<p>"How do the demons lure the heroes to sin?"</p>

<p>"By trying to make them forget that to be good is the only way to
be great."</p>

<p>"Do the heroes ever yield?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pilgrim, often, too often; and there is our great grief. If
they once yield, they die at the moment of sinning, and there is neither
storm at sea nor grief in the forest. We never can know when the bad
heroes pass away. But ah! it is when the true heroes, who, though
tempted, will not yield, die," and here Macrobius stretched out his
hands towards the dark line of trees as though in prayer, "that we
learn of it to our sorrow. Pilgrim!" he cried, while the tears, dry,
like the tears old men shed, trickled down his withered cheeks into his
white beard, "we were sure yesterday that we had lost another good
hero."</p>

<p>"And what made thee sure, good Macrobius?"</p>

<p>"Because we noticed that a comet, which we had seen for three
days before the storm, of a sudden grew dim, and that it shines no
more. Then, yesterday, when the sea was at its worst, we could hear
loud cries in the forest; feel tremblings in the earth under us; and in
the air about us there were breathings and black clouds. Listen, now,
the trees are calling some name, I know they are. I am old; my
hearing is faint. <a id="Do_you_not_hear_voices"></a>Do you not hear voices?"</p>

<div class="caption">"WE HAD LOST ANOTHER GOOD HERO."</div>
</div>

<p>Pantagruel listened intently; but, even with his quick ears, could
only hear a mournful sough, as though coming over the tops of the
trees from a great distance.</p>

<p>"Not voices, but more like sobs, good old man. They may be
weeping for the hero who died yesterday. Canst thou tell me his
name?"</p>

<p>"Ah, pilgrim, there, too, is our cross! It is not given to us to
learn the name of a hero who has died until a year after the forest has
moaned, and the sea has wept, and the earth has trembled."</p>

<p>"And how dost thou show him honor?"</p>

<p>"We place in this part of the forest which we are allowed to enter,
and on the tree he best loved when alive, a verse reciting his name, and
saying that another hero has died, but not until the good God had
given him the power to be greater than sin."</p>

GIANT WIDENOSTRILS HAD FOUND THE COCKS AND HENS WHICH
KILLED HIM. <a id="HOW_THE_PEOPLE_LIVED_BY_WIND"></a>HOW THE PEOPLE LIVED BY WIND.</h4>

</div>

<p>As soon as the ships had been calked and
repaired, and fresh food had been taken
in, James Brayer gave the word to sail;
and the fleet set out, with the feeble
shouts of the good old men in their
ears, from the Island of Macreons.</p>

<p>Two days after this the fleet touched
at the Island of Ruach, which Pantagruel
found to be the strangest, in one thing,
of any he had yet seen.</p>

<p>That one thing was <span class="smcap">wind</span>.</p>

<p>In other words, the people of Ruach
lived on <i>wind</i>. They had nothing else
to live on; they ate nothing, they drank nothing, but <i>wind</i>. The
very houses they built were always as near windmills as they could
build them. In their gardens they never grew cabbages, peas, beans,
radishes,&mdash;only three different kinds of anemones, or wind-flowers.
When they felt hungry, and there happened to be no wind stirring, the
common people of the island, to start a breeze, used fans of feathers,
or of paper, or of linen, as their means allowed. As for the rich, they
lived by the whirl of their windmills,&mdash;the finest and the strongest
wind, they declared, they could ever eat. Whenever they had a feast,
the Ruachians would spread their tables under one windmill, and, if the
table was long enough, it was made to stretch under two. While they
were eating, or rather drinking, in the wind from the great-winged
mills, the guests would be discussing among themselves the excellence,
beauty, and rarity of their various kinds of wind. One would
smack his lips, and whistle out,&mdash;they all whistled instead of talking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! how delightful this south-west breeze!"</p>

<p>Another: "How refreshing this south-east?"</p>

<p>Another: "But do taste a little of this western, I beg you! How
healthful!"</p>

<p>Another: "How choice this east-by-north!"</p>

<p>Another: "Will none of you join me in
this exquisite south?" <a id="and_so_forth"></a>and so forth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/145.jpg" width="400" height="327" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">THE LAND OF WIND.</div>
</div>

<p>Pantagruel wondered at all this whistling;
but he opened his eyes wider than ever when
he caught sight of a big, bloated fellow whipping, with his slipper,
a servant-man and a boy. When he asked what was the matter, he
was told that the bloated fellow had accused the man and the boy of
stealing from him the better half of a large leathern bag of southerly
wind, which he had put by for his own private winter-use. All Pantagruel
said to this was, "This is very strange." While he was on his
way to the King's palace, on invitation, he saw several of the islanders,
with large fans in their hands, taking a walk. The rich islanders were
all stout. The poor islanders were all thin. It was a fight for wind;
and the windmills and big fans won it.</p>

<p>The people of Ruach had these two proverbs always in their
mouths:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Small fans make small wind.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Great fans make great wind.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>These were the only proverbs which had ever been known among
them.</p>

<p>When he met the King of the island, Pantagruel began to pay him
compliments on the cheapness of the food of the people. "You live on
wind; it costs you nothing; you have only to breathe to take in your
food; you and your people must be very happy."</p>

<p>"Not so happy as you may think, noble Giant. We have our
troubles, like any other people."</p>

<p>"Troubles! Why, what troubles can you have?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. Every year, in the spring, a wicked Giant, named
Widenostrils, who lives, I believe, in the Island of Tohu, comes here
for his health by the advice of his physicians. The moment he steps
on shore he begins to swallow our windmills. We are not afraid of
Widenostrils for ourselves, although he is so horrid a monster; but we
have a mortal fear of him for our windmills. It will not be long before
there will be no more windmills left! Then what are we to do? We
must have wind; for <a id="without_wind_we_must_die"></a>without wind we must die."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/146.jpg" width="400" height="301" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">"WITHOUT WIND WE MUST DIE."</div>
</div>

<p>"Have you never tried to keep that wicked giant away?"</p>

<p>"Yes; often and often; and it was only last spring that we hit
upon what we thought to be a good plan. About the time we were
expecting a visit from Widenostrils, we sent to a neighboring island to
get us a supply of cocks and hens. As soon as we got them, we filled
our largest windmills with them. As usual, Widenostrils, when he
landed, began to gobble up one windmill after another. Very soon
the roosters began to crow, and the hens began to cackle, and both
began to fly about inside his stomach. Then Widenostrils got very
sick, and lay down in yonder field gasping for a whole day. As he
lay down the strangest thing happened."</p>

<p>"What was that, friend?"</p>

<p>"Of course, with the cocks and hens crowing and cackling and
making such a to-do in his stomach, here and there, Widenostrils kept
his mouth open, hoping they would get tired and fly out. Seeing his
big mouth open, what should all the foxes in the neighborhood, which
are very tame, as we never hunt them, scenting the cocks and hens
inside, do but scamper after them through the monster's throat? We
were afraid to have the wicked Giant die among us, so we managed to
rouse him, although he was very sick, and even helped him to reach
his ship, which sailed away at once. But of what use after all? Our
curse will be back next spring. If the cocks and hens and foxes
don't kill him, what can we do?"</p>

<p>"Have no more fear, friend," said Pantagruel; "Widenostrils, the
giant, the swallower of your windmills, is dead. I am sure of that, for
I myself saw his corpse in Tohu. One of my friends here can tell you
more. What, ho! Panurge!"</p>

<p>"That can I, your majesty," cried Panurge, stepping briskly forward.
"The Giant Widenostrils died from having too many cocks
and hens and foxes in his stomach. I heard in his stomach, with my
own ears,&mdash;which are pretty sharp ones,&mdash;as he lay stretched out in
the meadow, cocks crowing, hens cackling, foxes yelping, and by
my faith, I thought the foxes were getting the better of the cocks and
the hens."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven! We can build our dear windmills again, and we
shall not die," cried the King, who at once sent his herald to announce
the good news through the island.</p>

COULD NOT HURT.&mdash;THE POWER OF THE <a id="SIGN_OF_THE_CROSS"></a>SIGN OF THE
CROSS.</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 195px;">

</div>

<p>About sundown of the day when the
fleet left Ruach, as they were coming
near Wild Island, Pantagruel's keen eye
spied, far off, a huge whale, which, raised
above the waters higher than the maintop,
came straight towards the fleet,
blowing and spouting from its horrid
nostrils so high a stream of water that
it seemed to be a swollen river rushing
<a id="down_a_mountains_side"></a>down a mountain's side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/148.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL SPIES A MONSTER.</div>
</div>

<p>Pantagruel pointed out the whale
to the pilot and to Xenomanes. James
Brayer was the first one to give advice,
and his advice was always worth listening to. What he advised was
that the trumpets of the Thalmege should be sounded so as to warn all
the fleet to stand close, and look to themselves. At this alarm, every
ship, galleon, frigate, and brigantine (according to naval discipline)
placed itself in such order as to form the Greek Y,&mdash;the flag-ship
being in the centre. This proved that James Brayer, while being a
good sailor, had been landsman enough sometimes to watch cranes fly
in the air. For the letter Y is just the figure that the cranes in their
journeys&mdash;the leader always being in front&mdash;choose in winging their
long or short ways across the sky.</p>

<p>Of course the first one to get on the forecastle, where he could
have a word with the grenadiers, was Friar John! Brave Friar John!
He was the right-hand where anything strong or good was to be done.
As to Panurge, he began to cry and howl at the top of his voice.
"<i>Boo! boo! boo!</i> This is a worse business than that of the other day,"
he blubbered, shrugging up his shoulders and shivering in his fright.
"That frightful thing over there is the horrid Leviathan Job spoke of!
I am sure he is coming to swallow us all up, ships, sails, men and all,
like so many pills. Ah! friends, let's escape the monster. The land
is near; let us go on shore!"</p>

<p>"Panurge," said Pantagruel, turning round, "all thou hast to do
is to trust to me. Have no fear; I shall do its business presently."</p>

<p>"Oh, Your Highness knows well enough that I am never afraid
except when there is danger! <i>Boo! boo! boo!</i>"</p>

<p>While Panurge was whimpering, the monster had got fairly into
the Greek Y made by the fleet. It was the whale which began the
fight. The moment it found itself inside the angle, and saw the ships
on each side of it, it wheeled around and began to spout water by
whole tons upon them. Then it was that the ships took up the war.
They all set to work as though they were mad, to hurl against the
whale on every side arrows, spears, darts, javelins, and harpoons.
Never had there been seen such a storm of deadly weapons whistling
through the air at one time.</p>

<p>You may be sure that
Friar John did not spare himself.</p>

<p>Panurge <a id="nearly_died_from_fright"></a>nearly died from
fright.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/149.jpg" width="344" height="450" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">SHOOTING AT THE WHALE.</div>
</div>

<p>The artillery belched out
largest balls; but they
didn't do the least harm. All
they did was to strike the
monster's tough, black hide
and slant off. When he saw
how so much good powder was being wasted, Pantagruel thought it
was high time for him to keep his promise to Panurge. He had, when
a boy, a great name for throwing darts, javelins, and such missiles.
There was not a man around the Royal Palace of Utopia who had
not seen, more than once, his wonderful skill in dart-throwing; for,
with his immense darts, which were so large that they looked very
much like the huge beams that support the bridges of Nantes and
Saumur and Bergerac, he used, standing a mile off, to open an oyster
without breaking its shell; snuff a candle without putting it out;
shoot a magpie in the eye; and he had even been known to turn over
leaf after leaf of Friar John's breviary, and not tear one of them.
Pantagruel had already found out that there was a fine store of darts
in the ship, and he ordered a good supply to be laid on the deck before
him. With the first dart, hurled with a mighty force, he struck the
whale so furiously in the head that he pierced both its jaws and its
tongue, <a id="making_one_piece_of_the_three"></a>making one piece of the three.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/150.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">PANTAGRUEL TRIES HIS HAND.</div>
</div>

<p>This was a great victory. The monster could not spurt any more.</p>

<p>With the second dart he put out its right eye.</p>

<p>With the third he put out its left.</p>

<p>Then everybody began to crowd around to look in safety at the
whale, which, if it had not been for the Giant's darts, might have
ended in drowning the whole fleet, but which was now rolling and
staggering about on the waves, stunned and blinded. The creature
was still alive, and might yet do some harm; and so Pantagruel, who
was watching every movement, threw out a fourth dart, which struck
it under the tail. Then the giant began to hurl his darts, one after
another, on each side of the black hide, not wildly, but with the same
care and skill with which he had once turned the leaves of Friar John's
breviary. Fifty darts struck it on one side. Fifty darts more struck
it on the other side. This was too much for the monster. It turned
on its greasy back, as all dead fishes do, and floated without motion,
looking, with the beams and darts upside down in the water, like
a gigantic centipede crawling on the sea, with the tips of its hundred
feet just showing, every now and then, <a id="above_the_surface_of_the_waves"></a>above the surface of the waves.</p>

<div class="caption">THE DEATH OF THE MONSTER.</div>
</div>

<p>Just as soon as the whale was seen to be floating, James Brayer
shouted, "A boat's crew, to bring yonder carcass to the island!"</p>

<p>In a trice a boat manned by strong men, and filled with harpoons,
was towing the whale towards Wild Island. The Giant himself took
no notice of all this; but, having
seen from the deck a small deserted
seaport towards the south, he fixed on a
fine, pleasant grove near it, as a good place
to pitch tent and have a gay time after their victory.
Once there, Friar John, who was near his side, at a
word from the Giant, rang the bell for supper. Pantagruel took to
eating cheerfully with his men. Of a sudden, fierce cries were heard
from the forest, a half mile or so <a id="back_from_the_little_grove"></a>back from the little grove.</p>

<div class="caption">LANDING THE MONSTER.</div>
</div>

<p>"What is that?" asked Pantagruel of Xenomanes.</p>

<p>"Only the wild creatures, sir, who have given this Wild Island its
name. Some say they are demons. By raising your head you may
see them <a id="over_the_hill_in_yonder_thicket"></a>over the hill in yonder thicket."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/153.jpg" width="400" height="391" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">ON WILD ISLAND.</div>
</div>

<p>Pantagruel, without further word, rushed from the table to scour
the thicket. The whole company rose and followed him. It was not
long before he had, with great strides, reached the top of the ridge,
whence he could see a dark line, unbroken, save here and there by
black banners, of gigantic forms half lost in the shadows of the thicket.
The moment the dark shapes saw Pantagruel on the ridge, they began
to utter loud cries, and more than one mighty form stepped out from
the line to threaten. But when Friar John, Xenomanes, and the rest
appeared on the ridge, a howl of defiance broke from the thicket. The
dark masses seemed beside themselves with rage, and all at once the
line was broken.</p>

<p>"By my faith," said Pantagruel, "they are demons, Xenomanes!
Look, they have wings, and their wings are as black as their
banners!"</p>

<p>This was true. The dark masses had only broken so as to give
themselves space to raise their wings in triumph at seeing so many
wretched mortals ready for destruction. Often and often had crews,
thrown by shipwreck upon Wild Island, reached the shore and had
never been heard of more.</p>

<p>"These are demons; bless us, Friar John," whispered Pantagruel.
"What can sinful men do against them?"</p>

<p>And, even while saying this, and without knowing it, the prayerful
Giant was making the Sign of the Cross.</p>

<p>At the sacred sign there was, of a sudden, a lifting of black
banners. Then, with a flapping of heavy wings, a great stir of mighty
bodies leaving the thickets and rising into the air; the dark masses
came sweeping over the very ridge where Pantagruel was, on their
way to the sea, casting a blacker shadow than the coming night,
shrieking and wailing as they passed.</p>

<p>From that blessed day, shipwrecked sailors have wandered in
safety through the forest, and never met a demon.</p>

<p>For Wild Island is wild no more.</p>

<p>Next day, having been favored with a
fair wind all night, they stopped at the
Island of Sadness, where all the people
had once been very rich, but were then
very poor. Pantagruel found that nothing
was to be seen on such an island except
fear, want, and misery. So he did no
more than step, for a few moments, into
the church, near the harbor. On coming
out, he ordered that eighteen thousand
royal gold pieces should be given out
for the relief of the poor people, and
then he went on shipboard, not being
willing to stay there any longer.</p>

<p>Leaving this desolate island, a strong breeze sprang up, that
brought them, after one day, to the blessed Island of Papimany, where
lived a people so hospitable that some of them went every day to the
port to see if any strangers had come. As soon as anchor had been
dropped,&mdash;in fact, even before the ship had been well-moored,&mdash;four
chief men rowed out in a skiff to pay their respects to Pantagruel. On
the strangers going ashore, men, women, and children marched to
meet them in a procession that reached from one end of the island to
the other, and gave a welcome of cheers that lasted above <a id="a_quarter_of_an_hour"></a>a quarter of

<p>In the midst of all this joy, the school-master of the place,
anxious that his boys should miss no chance of seeing what was for
their good, came up with all his teachers, ushers, and school-boys, to
show them, with their own eyes, a Giant so tall and renowned as
Pantagruel. After which, in order to keep the lads
from ever forgetting what they had seen, the chief
school-master threw off his gown and went to work in
a hurry to give each of them a sound thrashing. This
displeased the Giant so greatly that he shouted, "If
you do not leave off whipping those poor
children, I shall go at once." In his fright at
this great voice booming so high up in the air,
the chief school-master dropped his rod with
one hand, and, with his other, the poor little
fellow whose turn had just come, while all the
boys, big and little&mdash;those who had had their
whipping, as well as
those who hadn't had
it&mdash;crowded
around the good
Giant's big feet
to thank him.</p>

<p>At this moment
the Mayor
rode up on a
mule with green
trappings, and carried Pantagruel and his party off to dinner. Nothing
could be finer than the feasting of this good people; but Pantagruel,
anxious to catch the good wind which was then springing up,
only stayed for this grand dinner. Before leaving, he had his men
to bring on shore nine pieces of cloth of gold, which he presented to

<p>Out at sea once more, they sailed on for several days without
incident. One day, however, when they were at table eating, drinking,
and telling stories, Pantagruel went on deck to look at the sea.
After looking out a while, he began to turn his great ears towards the
sky, and it was then he called out, "Do you hear nothing, gentlemen?
It seems to me some people are talking above us, yet I can see no one.
Listen!" So the whole company got up from the table, ran on deck,
and set to cocking up their eyes and clapping
their hands to their ears; but all would not
do; they could neither see nor hear anything. Pantagruel, standing
with his eyes still looking up, continued to hear the voices. At
last some sharp-eared fellow cried, "I think I hear <i>something</i>."
Then, all at once, every man on board began to cry out that he
could plainly hear voices of men and neighing of horses; but,
as nothing could be seen, everybody was mightily frightened, and
Panurge worse than all. Nothing would do him but to beg Friar John
to stay by him, saying that they were all undone, and that there
was no fooling with the devil. "We are undone," he whimpered.
"Just listen to those guns. Let's flee! There are our sails and oars;
why can't we use them? I never was brave at sea; not that I am
afraid! Oh, no! for I fear nothing but danger, that I don't! We are
all dead men; <a id="Set_off_set_off"></a>Set off! set off!"</p>

<div class="caption">ENTERING THE FROZEN SEA.</div>
</div>

<p>Pantagruel, hearing all this noise, called out, without turning
about, "Who talks of fleeing? Let us see, rather, who these people
may be; they may be friends. I can discover nothing, though I can
see, with my eyes, a hundred miles around." Just then, James Brayer
came up, as if he
had something important
on his mind,
and said, "Have no
fear, my lord; I can
make all this clear.
We are on the confines
of the Frozen
Sea. At the beginning
of last winter,
a great and bloody
battle was fought
not far from here.
Then the words and
shouts of the men;
the hacking and
clashing of battle-axes;
the jostling of
armor: the neighing
of horses, and all
the noise and din of
battle, froze in the
air; and now, the
winter being over,
and the summer
having come, all
these sounds have
melted, and we can
hear them."</p>

<p>Pantagruel, who
at first had thought
it to be witchcraft,
which he hated
above all things, of
a sudden cried out,
"Why, sure enough, here are some tumbling down that are <a id="not_yet_thawed"></a>not yet
thawed!"</p>

<img src="images/158.jpg" width="400" height="383" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">A SHOWER OF FROZEN WORDS.</div>
</div>

<p>He then threw on deck a handful of what seemed to be rough
sugar-plums, but which were, in fact, frozen words. Everybody&mdash;even
Panurge, who, by this time had plucked up heart, on hearing
what James Brayer had said&mdash;ran here and there, picking up the
sugar-plums. Pantagruel was sure that he had never seen, in all his
travels, anything quite so odd as these sugar-plums; for many of them
melted almost before he could throw them down, leaving his hand all
wet with water; while his ears were stunned from below by the awful
shouts and groans of men, the whistling of bullets, the heavy boom
of cannon, and the wild, shrill neighing of war-horses, which all came
out as those queer <a id="sugar-plums_melted_on_deck"></a>sugar-plums melted on deck.</p>

<div class="caption">LANDING ON THE ROCKS.</div>
</div>

<p>The next day Pantagruel went ashore on a rugged, craggy, barren
island, where cocks are never heard to crow, and where lived Gaster,
the first Master of Arts in the world. Being himself a scholar, he
wanted to make the acquaintance of the First Master of Arts. He
found him a most wonderful and despotic old king, who talked with
every one by signs, for he could not hear, having been born without
ears. Gaster never bothered himself for anybody's comfort or convenience
but his own, and Pantagruel soon noticed that no one ever
tried to reason with him. At his smallest sign, all present, whether
courtiers or foreigners, anxiously inquired what was his will, and
hurried off, running themselves out of breath, and knocking each
other over in their hurry to do what he wanted. Pantagruel watched
Master Gaster very closely, in order to see if he deserved his great
name for learning. He was not long in finding out that the old
glutton, being a great lover of corn, had invented machines for
cultivating it, and many mills for grinding it fine and white; also
recipes for baking it into delicious loaves and cakes, for Master
Gaster made signs that nothing put him into a greater passion than
heavy bread. He also had a knowledge of many curious arts that he
had studied out for the preservation of his beloved corn,&mdash;such as
keeping the rain up in the air, and how to coax it down just at the
time it was wanted; also a way to destroy the hail, and prevent the
winds from blowing, and to crush the storms, and a thousand <a id="other_wonderful_things"></a>other
wonderful things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/160.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">MASTER GASTER.</div>
</div>

<p>Master Epistemon was greatly interested in all these fine inventions,
and prevailed upon Pantagruel to stay much longer than he
wished, for this First Master of Arts, with all his wisdom, had very
rude manners. Pantagruel, not being very skilful, as we already
know, in talking by signs, got so tired after a while that he couldn't
put up with it any longer; so he turned his broad back upon the
greedy old man, and gave the order to go on board.</p>

<p>Not long after they were under way the wind fell, so that there
was not a capful in all the sails of the fleet. Pantagruel's ship could
hardly get along, although James Brayer kept tacking
all the time. Everybody was put out of sorts by
this accident, and moped about,
scarcely speaking a word to each other. Pantagruel
nodded over his book on the quarter-deck; Panurge
idly played with a piece of rope, pulling it about
with his teeth; while Friar
John marched off to the pantry, to see what the cook
might be doing. After two or three hours in the galley,
here came Friar John, puffing and blowing, to Pantagruel,
upstairs. Finding him awake, he asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will Your Highness be so kind as to tell us how a man
can kill time and raise a good wind at sea?"</p>

<p>Pantagruel gave a yawn, and said, half-laughing, "A good dinner will
kill time quicker than anything else, as you, my good Friar John,
better than most men, know. Have dinner served! Maybe the wind will
come with the dinner."</p>

<p>Friar John needed no second hint. It was the good Friar's boast that
he knew and loved the ceremonies of the kitchen much better than he
did those of the court. So, at these words, he hurried downstairs, and
soon marched in at the head of the stewards, cup-bearers, and carvers,
who bore four stately meat-pasties. At the sight of these fine viands
all the mouths began to water, and they were soon<a id="deep_in_feasting_and_drinking"></a> deep in feasting and
drinking.</p>

<img src="images/161.jpg" width="406" height="500" alt="Plate" />
<div class="caption">THE ISLE OF GANABIM.</div>
</div>

<p>While they were thus passing their time merrily, and making up riddles
for Pantagruel to guess, the dull weather also passed away; and, the
breeze having freshened, with full sails set, they were soon making
up for the time they had lost. Not long after, they came in sight
of a high land, which Pantagruel, first discovering, pointed out to
Xenomanes, and asked him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is that high rock yonder, with two tops?"</p>

<p>"That, Your Highness, is the Island of Ganabim. The people who live
there are all thieves. Yet there is on the top of that very mountain a
fountain worth seeing, since it is the finest fountain in the world.
Does Your Highness wish to go on shore?"</p>

<p>"Ho! not I," replied Pantagruel; "but, for the honor of the finest
fountain in the world, we ought to give a salute as we pass." As the
flag-ship came just in front of the rock the gunner fired. At once, the
gunners of the other ships gave, every one, a gun to the island, which
made so mighty a noise that it seemed as if the sky was about <a id="tumbling_down_in_thunder"></a>tumbling
down in thunder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/162.jpg" width="374" height="400" alt="Engraving" />
<div class="caption">SHARP ISLAND.</div>
</div>

<p>The next day they sighted Sharp Island, an unhealthy country, with
rocks shooting up in an ugly way everywhere through the barren soil.
The pilot pointed out two cube-shaped rocks that were so white they
might have been taken for alabaster. He said they were filled with
demons and caused more wrecks, both of men and goods, than the famous
Scylla and Charybdis. Of course, the flag-ship and all the fleet
steered far out to sea in passing Sharp Island.</p>

<p>Sailing four days, toward nightfall of the last day, they came
near the fairy-like shores of Lanternland. For leagues around the sea
seemed twinkling with fires, that gave a tremulous sparkle, or, darting
up into bright light, hovered a while over the water, and then would be
lost, only to be found again shining
nearer and brighter than before.
James Brayer said that the whole coast
was planted with light-houses. Xenomanes
confirmed this, adding, that "there was no port in the world equal
to those of Lanternland, and no coast where <a id="the_piloting_was_so_safe"></a>the piloting was so safe."</p>

<div class="caption">THE SHORES OF LANTERNLAND.</div>
</div>

<p>Here they stopped for a day, and were received with great
friendship by the Queen of that country. Pantagruel was greatly
vexed that he could not speak the Lantern language, so as to talk
with Her Majesty; but, Panurge, who understood it just as well
as he did his maternal French, acted as his interpreter. After supping
with Her Majesty in the royal banquet hall, Pantagruel asked whether
he had reached the island too late to be in time for their great Annual
Fair. He was told that the Fair was already over; and he then
acquainted the Queen with the purpose of his voyage, and prayed her
to grant him a guide to the Kingdom of India. Of course the Queen
was greatly interested when she heard that it was love for the bright
little Princess of India which had brought a Giant so great a distance.
She promised all he asked, and assured him that he should have her
own particular guide&mdash;the best in all Lanternland&mdash;to <a id="go_with_them_the_next_morning"></a>go with them
the next morning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/j.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="Plate" />
<div class="caption">THE QUEEN OF LANTERNS.</div>
</div>

<p>Pantagruel, after saluting Her Majesty with such majestic grace as
became so stately a prince, withdrew, followed by his friends, to
take some rest. The next day, having first seen that their guide was
on board, they took their leave, amid the glad cheers and huzzas of the
good Lanternists, who vowed that, if they had only stopped one more
night, they would have made such a blaze along the coast as would
have lighted them half-way to India.</p>

<p>Every story must have its ending.</p>

<p>And the ending of this story is that the good Prince Pantagruel,
led by his guide from Lanternland, first passed over the Caspian
mountains in search of his charming Princess; then defied the Cannibals;
conquered the Island of Pearls; and, at last, after reaching
India, married the lovely daughter of King Prestham of that land.</p>

<p>To tell the story of the supper which good King Gargantua had
promised to give Pantagruel, and which was to equal that of King
Ahasuerus, and of the great and valorous deeds of Pantagruel, after his
marriage, would make a history much more wonderful than what you
have just read. But this is a part of his life which the Wise Man&mdash;who
so loved the three good Giants, <span class="smcap">Grandgousier, Gargantua,</span>
and <span class="smcap">Pantagruel</span>&mdash;promised to write, but never did.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
